# Cartoonified Image
Computer Vision as we know is a very powerful tool with immense possibilities.<br>
So, why not to use it?<br>
Here, I have implemented a script that will read the original image and convert the original image into cartoonified image.<br>
The original image is converted into cartoonified image as well as there is an another approach by using `cv2.stylization()`

### Results:

#### Original Image

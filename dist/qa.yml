  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default or stolen passwords
    (according to [this Verizon report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_dbir-2016-executive-summary_xg_en.pdf)).
    Use long, strong and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable
    2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches and take care while logging into your accounts.
  checklist:
    - point: Use a Strong Password
      priority: dependancy
      details: >-
        If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places or names- then it can be easily
        cracked through brute force, or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password, is by
        making it long (12+ characters)- consider using a 'passphrase', made up of many words. Alternatively,
        use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with
        [HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net), to get an idea of how quickly common
        passwords can be cracked. Read more about creating strong passwords:
        [securityinabox.org](https://securityinabox.org/en/passwords/passwords-and-2fa/)

    - point: Don't reuse Passwords
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If someone was to reuse a password, and one site they had an account with suffered a leak, then a
        criminal could easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts. This is usually done through
        large-scale automated login requests, and it is called Credential Stuffing. Unfortunately this is all
        too common, but it's simple to protect against- use a different password for each of your online accounts

    - point: Use a Secure Password Manager
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        For most people it is going to be near-impossible to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords.
        A password manager is an application that generates, stores and auto-fills your login credentials for you.
        All your passwords will be encrypted against 1 master passwords (which you must remember, and it should be
        very strong). Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so whatever device you are on,
        your passwords can be auto-filled. A good all-rounder is
        [Bitwarden](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/bitwarden), or see
        [Recommended Password Managers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers)

    - point: Avoid sharing passwords
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        While there may be times that you need to share access to an account with another person, you should
        generally avoid doing this because it makes it easier for the account to become compromised. If you
        absolutely do need to share a password for example when working on a team with a shared account this
        should be done via features built into a password manager.

    - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a
        code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has got your password (e.g. through phishing,
        malware or a data breach), they will not be able to log into your account. It's easy to get started,
        download [an authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication)
        onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Next
        time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that displays in the app on your phone
        (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30-seconds)

    - point: Keep Backup Codes Safe
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
        your 2FA method is lost, broken or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
        unauthorized access. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g. in offline storage
        or in an encrypted file/drive). Don't store these in your Password Manager as 2FA sources and passwords
        and should be kept separately.

    - point: Sign up for Breach Alerts
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        After a website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. There
        are several websites that collect these leaked records, and allow you to search your email address to check
        if you are in any of their lists. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com), [Have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
        and [DeHashed](https://dehashed.com) allow you to sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your
        email address appears in any new data sets. It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens, so
        that you can change your passwords for the affected accounts. [Have i been pwned](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/have-i-been-pwned) also has domain-wide
        notification, where you can receive alerts if any email addresses under your entire domain appear (useful if
        you use aliases for [anonymous forwarding](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding))

    - point: Shield your Password/ PIN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of site of a CCTV camera and
        that no one is able to see over your shoulder. Cover your password or pin code while you type, and do not
        reveal any plain text passwords on screen

    - point: Update Critical Passwords Periodically
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Database leaks and breaches are common, and it is likely that several of your passwords are already somewhere
        online. Occasionally updating passwords of security-critical accounts can help mitigate this. But providing
        that all your passwords are long, strong and unique, there is no need to do this too often- annually should be
        sufficient. Enforcing mandatory password changes within organisations is [no longer recommended](https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes),
        as it encourages colleagues to select weaker passwords

    - point: Don’t save your password in browsers
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Most modern browsers offer to save your credentials when you log into a site. Don’t allow this, as they are
        not always encrypted, hence could allow someone to gain access into your accounts. Instead use a dedicated
        password manager to store (and auto-fill) your passwords

    - point: Avoid logging in on someone else’s device
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Avoid logging on other people's computer, since you can't be sure their system is clean. Be especially cautious
        of public machines, as malware and tracking is more common here. Using someone else's device is especially
        dangerous with critical accounts like online banking. When using someone else's machine, ensure that you're in a
        private/ incognito session (Use Ctrl+Shift+N/ Cmd+Shift+N). This will request browser to not save your credentials,
        cookies and browsing history.

    - point: Avoid password hints
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Some sites allow you to set password hints. Often it is very easy to guess answers. In cases where password hints
        are mandatory use random answers and record them in password manager (`Name of the first school: 6D-02-8B-!a-E8-8F-81`)

    - point: Never answer online security questions truthfully
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If a site asks security questions (such as place of birth, mother's maiden name or first car etc), don't provide
        real answers. It is a trivial task for hackers to find out this information online or through social engineering.
        Instead, create a fictitious answer, and store it inside your password manager. Using real-words is better than
        random characters, [explained here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29244870)

    - point: Don’t use a 4-digit PIN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Don’t use a short PIN to access your smartphone or computer. Instead, use a text password or much longer pin.
        Numeric passphrases are easy crack, (A 4-digit pin has 10,000 combinations, compared to 7.4 million for a
        4-character alpha-numeric code)

    - point: Avoid using SMS for 2FA
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When enabling multi-factor authentication, opt for app-based codes or a hardware token, if supported. SMS is
        susceptible to a number of common threats, such as [SIM-swapping](https://www.maketecheasier.com/sim-card-hijacking)
        and [interception](https://secure-voice.com/ss7_attacks). There's also no guarantee of how securely your phone
        number will be stored, or what else it will be used for. From a practical point of view, SMS will only work when
        you have signal, and can be slow. If a website or service requires the usage of a SMS number for recovery consider
        purchasing a second pre-paid phone number only used for account recovery for these instances.

    - point: Avoid using your PM to Generate OTPs
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Many password managers are also able to generate 2FA codes. It is best not to use your primary password manager
        as your 2FA authenticator as well, since it would become a single point of failure if compromised. Instead use a
        dedicated [authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication) on your phone or laptop

    - point: Avoid Face Unlock
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Most phones and laptops offer a facial recognition authentication feature, using the camera to compare a snapshot
        of your face with a stored hash. It may be very convenient, but there are numerous ways to [fool it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2017/09/18/security-apple-face-id-iphone-x/)
        and gain access to the device, through digital photos and reconstructions from CCTV footage. Unlike your password-
        there are likely photos of your face on the internet, and videos recorded by surveillance cameras

    - point: Watch out for Keyloggers
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A hardware [keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger) is a physical device planted between
        your keyboard and the USB port, which intercepts all key strokes, and sometimes relays data to a remote server.
        It gives a hacker access to everything typed, including passwords. The best way to stay protected, is just by
        checking your USB connection after your PC has been unattended. It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted
        inside the keyboard housing, so look for any signs that the case has been tampered with, and consider bringing your
        own keyboard to work. Data typed on a virtual keyboard, pasted from the clipboard or auto-filled by a password
        manager can not be intercepted by a hardware keylogger.

    - point: Consider a Hardware Token
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A U2F/ FIDO2 security key is a USB (or NFC) device that you insert while logging in to an online service, in to
        verify your identity, instead of entering a OTP from your authenticator. [SoloKey](https://solokeys.com) and
        [NitroKey](https://www.nitrokey.com) are examples of such keys. They bring with them several security benefits,
        since the browser communicates directly with the device and cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting
        authentication, because the TLS certificate is checked. [This post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/71704) is
        a good explanation of the security of using FIDO U2F tokens. Of course it is important to store the physical key
        somewhere safe, or keep it on your person. Some online accounts allow for several methods of 2FA to be enabled

    - point: Consider Offline Password Manager
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For increased security, an encrypted offline password manager will give you full control over your data.
        [KeePass](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/keepass) is a popular choice, with lots of [plugins](https://[KeePass](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/keepass).info/plugins.html) and
        community forks with additional compatibility and functionality. Popular clients include: [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)
        (desktop), [KeePassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com) (Android) and [StrongBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strongbox-password-safe/id897283731)
        (iOS). The drawback being that it may be slightly less convenient for some, and it will be up to you to back it up,
        and store it securely

    - point: Consider Unique Usernames
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Having different passwords for each account is a good first step, but if you also use a unique username, email or
        phone number to log in, then it will be significantly harder for anyone trying to gain unauthorised access. The easiest
        method for multiple emails, is using auto-generated aliases for anonymous mail forwarding. This is where
        [anything]@yourdomain.com will arrive in your inbox, allowing you to use a different email for each account (see
        [Mail Alias Providers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding)). Usernames are easier,
        since you can use your password manager to generate, store and auto-fill these. Virtual phone numbers can be generated
        through your VOIP provider

  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  intro: >-
    Most websites on the internet will use some form of tracking, often to gain
    insight into their users behaviour and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed, and so is extremely valuable to corporations, governments and intellectual
    property thieves. Data breaches and leaks are common, and deanonymizing users web
    activity is often a trivial task.


    There are two primary methods of tracking; stateful (cookie-based), and stateless
    (fingerprint-based). Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in your browser
    with a unique ID that is used to identify you. Browser fingerprinting is a highly
    accurate way to identify and track users wherever they go online. The information
    collected is quite comprehensive, and often includes browser details, OS, screen
    resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and font preferences,
    and even hardware configurations.


    This section outlines the steps you can take, to be better protected from threats,
    minimise online tracking and improve privacy.
  checklist:
    - point: Block Ads
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy, by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
        [uBlock Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin) is a very
        efficient and open source browser addon,
        developed by Raymond Hill. When 3rd-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
        track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which can then be sold, or used
        to show you more targeted ads, and some ads are plain malicious or fake. Blocking ads also makes pages
        load faster, uses less data and provides a less cluttered experience.

    - point: Ensure Website is Legitimate
      priority: Basic
      details: >-
        It may sound obvious, but when you logging into any online accounts, double check the URL is correct.
        Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
        visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: Browser warnings, redirects,
        on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool, such as:
        [Virus Total](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/virus-total),
        [IsLegitSite](https://www.islegitsite.com), [Google Safe Browsing Status](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search)
        if you are unsure.

    - point: Watch out for Browser Malware
      priority: Basic
      details: >-
        Your system or browser can be compromised by spyware, miners, browser hijackers, malicious redirects,
        adware etc. You can usually stay protected, just by: ignoring pop-ups, be wary of what your clicking,
        don't proceed to a website if your browser warns you it may be malicious. Common signs of browser malware
        include: default search engine or homepage has been modified, toolbars, unfamiliar extensions or icons,
        significantly more ads, errors and pages loading much slower than usual. These articles from Heimdal
        explain [signs of browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/warning-signs-operating-system-infected-malware),
        [how browsers get infected](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/practical-online-protection-where-malware-hides)
        and [how to remove browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/malware-removal).

    - point: Use a Privacy-Respecting Browser
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox) (with a few tweaks)
        and [Brave](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/brave-browser)
        are secure, private-respecting browsers. Both are fast, open source, user-friendly and available on all
        major operating systems. Your browser has access to everything that you do online, so if possible, avoid
        Google Chrome, Edge and Safari as (without correct configuration) all three of them, collect usage data,
        call home and allow for invasive tracking. Firefox requires a few changes to achieve optimal security,
        for example - [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki) or [12byte](https://12bytes.org/firefox-configuration-guide-for-privacy-freaks-and-performance-buffs/)'s
        user.js configs. See more: [Privacy Browsers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#browsers).

    - point: Use a Private Search Engine
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Using a privacy-preserving, non-tracking search engine, will reduce risk that your search terms are not
        logged, or used against you. Consider [DuckDuckGo](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/duckduckgo),
        or [Qwant](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/qwant).
        Google implements some [incredibly invasive](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea)
        tracking policies, and have a history of displaying [biased search results](https://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-that-google-search-results-are-biased-2014-10).
        Therefore Google, along with Bing, Baidu, Yahoo and Yandex are incompatible with anyone looking to protect
        their privacy. It is recommended to update your [browsers default search](https://duckduckgo.com/install)
        to a privacy-respecting search engine.

    - point: Remove Unnecessary Browser Addons
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Extensions are able to see, log or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent looking
        browser apps, have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed, and may
        use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/ track you. Both [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox) and Chrome
        web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an extension requires before you install it.
        Check the reviews. Only install extensions you really need, and removed those which you haven't used in a while.

    - point: Keep Browser Up-to-date
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Browser vulnerabilities are constantly being [discovered](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=browser)
        and patched, so it’s important to keep it up to date, to avoid a zero-day exploit. You can [see which browser
        version you're using here](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/), or follow [this guide](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-update-your-browser/)
        for instructions on how to update. Some browsers will auto-update to the latest stable version.

    - point: Check for HTTPS
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If you enter information on a non-HTTPS website, this data is transported unencrypted and can therefore
        be read by anyone who intercepts it. Do not enter any data on a non-HTTPS website, but also do not let
        the green padlock give you a false sense of security, just because a website has SSL certificate, does
        not mean that it is legitimate or trustworthy. [HTTPS-Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
        (developed by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)) used to be a browser extension/addon that automatically
        enabled HTTPS on websites, but as of 2022 is now deprecated. In their [accouncement article](https://www.eff.org/)
        the EFF explains that most browsers now integrate such protections. Additionally, it provides instructions
        for [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox), Chrome, Edge and Safari browsers on how to enable their HTTPS secure protections.

    - point: Use DNS-over-HTTPS
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Traditional DNS makes requests in plain text for everyone to see. It allows for eavesdropping and
        manipulation of DNS data through man-in-the-middle attacks. Whereas DNS-over-HTTPS performs DNS
        resolution via the HTTPS protocol, meaning data between you and your DNS resolver is encrypted.
        A popular option is [CloudFlare](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/dns-providers/cloudflare)'s [1.1.1.1](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/1.1.1.1), or compare providers- it is simple to enable in-browser.
        Note that DoH comes with its own issues, mostly preventing web filtering.

    - point: Multi-[Session](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-messaging/session) Containers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Compartmentalisation is really important to keep different aspects of your browsing separate. For
        example, using different profiles for work, general browsing, social media, online shopping etc
        will reduce the number associations that data brokers can link back to you. One option is to make
        use of [Firefox Containers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/firefox-multi-account-containers)
        which is designed exactly for this purpose.
        Alternatively, you could
        use different browsers for different tasks
        ([Brave](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/brave-browser),
        [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox),
        [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor) etc).

    - point: Use Incognito
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When using someone else's machine, ensure that you're in a private/ incognito session. This will
        prevent browser history, cookies and some data being saved, but is not fool-proof- you can still
        be tracked.

    - point: Understand Your Browser Fingerprint
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Browser Fingerprinting is an incredibly accurate method of tracking, where a website identifies you
        based on your device information. You can view your fingerprint at amiunique.org- The aim is to be
        as un-unique as possible.

    - point: Manage Cookies
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Clearing cookies regularly is one step you can take to help reduce websites from tracking you.
        Cookies may also store your session token, which if captured, would allow someone to access your
        accounts without credentials. To mitigate this you should clear cookies often.

    - point: Block Third-Party Cookies
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Third-party cookies placed on your device by a website other than the one you’re visiting. This
        poses a privacy risk, as a 3rd entity can collect data from your current session. This guide explains
        how you can disable 3rd-party cookies, and you can check here ensure this worked.

    - point: Block Third-Party Trackers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Blocking trackers will help to stop websites, advertisers, analytics and more from tracking you in
        the background. [Privacy Badger](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/privacy-badger),
        [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/privacy-essentials),
        [uBlock Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin) and uMatrix (advanced)
        are all very effective, open source tracker-blockers available for all major browsers.

    - point: Beware of Redirects
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        While some redirects are harmless, others, such as Unvalidated redirects are used in phishing attacks,
        it can make a malicious link seem legitimate. If you are unsure about a redirect URL, you can check
        where it forwards to with a tool like RedirectDetective.

    - point: Do Not Sign Into Your Browser
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Many browsers allow you to sign in, in order to sync history, bookmarks and other browsing data across
        devices. However this not only allows for further data collection, but also increases attack surface
        through providing another avenue for a malicious actor to get hold of personal information.

    - point: Disallow Prediction Services
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Some browsers allow for prediction services, where you receive real-time search results or URL auto-fill.
        If this is enabled then data is sent to Google (or your default search engine) with every keypress,
        rather than when you hit enter.

    - point: Avoid G Translate for Webpages
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When you visit a web page written in a foreign language, you may be prompted to install the Google Translate
        extension. Be aware that Google collects all data (including input fields), along with details of the current
        user. Instead use a translation service that is not linked to your browser.

    - point: Disable Web Notifications
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Browser push notifications are a common method for criminals to encourage you to click their link, since
        it is easy to spoof the source. Be aware of this, and for instructions on disabling browser notifications,
        see this article.

    - point: Disable Automatic Downloads
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Drive-by downloads is a common method of getting harmful files onto a users device. This can be mitigated
        by disabling auto file downloads, and be cautious of websites which prompt you to download files unexpectedly.

    - point: Disallow Access to Sensors
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Mobile websites can tap into your device sensors without asking. If you grant these permissions to your
        browser once, then all websites are able to use these capabilities, without permission or notification.

    - point: Disallow Location
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Location Services lets sites ask for your physical location to improve your experience. This should be
        disabled in settings. Note that there are still other methods of determining your approximate location.

    - point: Disallow Camera/ Microphone access
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Check browser settings to ensure that no websites are granted access to webcam or microphone. It may also
        be beneficial to use physical protection such as a webcam cover and microphone blocker.

    - point: Disable Browser Password Saves
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Do not allow your browser to store usernames and passwords. These can be easily viewed or accessed.
        Instead use a password manager.

    - point: Disable Browser Autofill
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Turn off autofill for any confidential or personal details. This feature can be harmful if your browser
        is compromised in any way. Instead, consider using your password manager's Notes feature.

    - point: Protect from Exfil Attack
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        The CSS Exfiltrate attack is a method where credentials and other sensitive details can be snagged with
        just pure CSS. You can stay protected,
        with the [CSS Exfil Protection](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/css-exfil-protection) plugin.

    - point: Deactivate ActiveX
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        ActiveX is a browser extension API that built into Microsoft IE, and enabled by default. It's not commonly
        used anymore, but since it gives plugins intimate access rights, and can be dangerous, therefore you should
        disable it.

    - point: Disable WebRTC
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        WebRTC allows high-quality audio/video communication and peer-to-peer file-sharing straight from the
        browser. However it can pose as a privacy leak. To learn more, check out this guide.

    - point: Spoof HTML5 Canvas Sig
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Canvas Fingerprinting allows websites to identify and track users very accurately. You can use the
        Canvas-Fingerprint-Blocker extension to spoof your fingerprint or
        use [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor).

    - point: Spoof User Agent
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        The user agent tells the website what device, browser and version you are using. Switching user agent
        periodically is one small step you can take to become less unique.

    - point: Disregard DNT
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Enabling Do Not Track has very limited impact, since many websites do not respect or follow this. Since
        it is rarely used, it may also add to your signature, making you more unique.

    - point: Prevent HSTS Tracking
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        HSTS was designed to help secure websites, but privacy concerns have been raised as it allowed site
        operators to plant super-cookies. It can be disabled by visiting chrome://net-internals/#hsts in
        Chromium-based browsers.

    - point: Prevent Automatic Browser Connections
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Even when you are not using your browser, it may call home to report on usage activity, analytics and
        diagnostics. You may wish to disable some of this, which can be done through the settings.

    - point: Enable 1st-Party Isolation
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        [First Party Isolation](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/first-party-isolation) means
        that all identifier sources and browser state are scoped using the URL bar
        domain, this can greatly reduce tracking.

    - point: Strip Tracking Params from URLs
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Websites often append additional GET parameters to URLs that you click, to identify information like
        source/referrer. You can sanitize manually,
        or use an extension like [ClearURLs](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/clearurls) to strip tracking data
        from URLs automatically.

    - point: First Launch Security
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        After installing a web browser, the first time you launch it (prior to configuring its privacy settings),
        most browsers will call home. Therefore, after installing a browser, you should first disable your internet
        connection, then configure privacy options before reenabling your internet connectivity.

    - point: Use The Tor Browser
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor) Project provides a browser that encrypts and routes your traffic through multiple nodes, keeping
        users safe from interception and tracking. The main drawbacks are speed and user experience.

    - point: Disable JavaScript
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Many modern web apps are JavaScript-based, so disabling it will greatly decrease your browsing experience.
        But if you really want to go all out, then it will really reduce your attack surface.

  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
    Nearly 50 years since the first email was sent, it's still very much a big part
    of our day-to-day life, and will continue to be for the near future. So considering
    how much trust we put in them, it's surprising how fundamentally insecure this
    infrastructure is. Email-related fraud
    [is on the up](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247670/email/email-security-in-2018.html),
    and without taking basic measures you could be at risk.


    If a hacker gets access to your emails, it provides a gateway for your other
    accounts to be compromised (through password resets), therefore email security
    is paramount for your digital safety.


    The big companies providing "free" email service, don't have a good reputation
    for respecting users privacy: Gmail was caught giving
    [third parties full access](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-dirty-secret-the-app-developers-sifting-through-your-gmail-1530544442)
    to user emails and also [tracking all of your purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html).
    Yahoo was also caught scanning emails in real-time [for US surveillance agencies](http://news.trust.org/item/20161004170601-99f8c)
    Advertisers [were granted access](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/08/29/both-yahoo-and-aol-are-scanning-customer-emails-to-attract-advertisers)
    to Yahoo and AOL users messages to “identify and segment potential customers by picking up on contextual buying signals, and past purchases.”

  checklist:
    - point: Have more than one email address
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such
        as newsletters. This compartmentalization could reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach,
        and also make it easier to recover a compromised account.

    - point: Keep Email Address Private
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most
        phishing attacks.

    - point: Keep your Account Secure
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging in. Your email account
        provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

    - point: Disable Automatic Loading of Remote Content
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Email messages can contain remote content such as images or stylesheets, often automatically loaded
        from the server. You should disable this, as it exposes your IP address and device information, and
        is often used for tracking. For more info, see [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20680903/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download).

    - point: Use Plaintext
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        There are two main types of emails on the internet: plaintext and HTML. The former is strongly preferred
        for privacy & security as HTML messages often include identifiers in links and inline images, which can
        collect usage and personal data. There's also numerous risks of remote code execution targeting the HTML
        parser of your mail client, which cannot be exploited if you are using plaintext. For more info, as well
        as setup instructions for your mail provider, see [UsePlaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/).

    - point: Don’t connect third-party apps to your email account
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If you give a third-party app or plug-in full access to your inbox, they effectively have full unhindered
        access to all your emails and their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks.

    - point: Don't Share Sensitive Data via Email
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Emails are very easily intercepted. Furthermore, you can’t be sure of how secure your recipient's
        environment is. Therefore, emails cannot be considered safe for exchanging confidential information,
        unless it is encrypted.

    - point: Consider Switching to a Secure Mail Provider
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Secure and reputable email providers such as [Forward Email](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-email/forward-email),
        [ProtonMail](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/mail-forwarding/protonmail),
        and [Tutanota](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-email/tuta) allow for end-to-end
        encryption, full privacy as well as more security-focused features. Unlike typical email providers, your
        mailbox cannot be read by anyone but you, since all messages are encrypted.

    - point: Use Smart Key
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        OpenPGP does not support Forward secrecy, which means if either your or the recipient's private key is
        ever stolen, all previous messages encrypted with it will be exposed. Therefore, you should take great
        care to keep your private keys safe. One method of doing so, is to use a USB Smart Key to sign or decrypt
        messages, allowing you to do so without your private key leaving the USB device.

    - point: Use Aliasing / Anonymous Forwarding
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and still land in your primary inbox.
        Effectively allowing you to use a different, unique email address for each service you sign up for. This means
        if you start receiving spam, you can block that alias and determine which company leaked your email address.

    - point: Subaddressing
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        An alternative to aliasing is subaddressing, where anything after the `+` symbol is omitted during mail delivery.
        This enables you to keep track of who shared/ leaked your email address, but unlike aliasing, it will not protect
        against your real address being revealed.

    - point: Use a Custom Domain
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Using a custom domain means that you are not dependent on the address assigned by your mail provider. So you can
        easily switch providers in the future and do not need to worry about a service being discontinued.

    - point: Sync with a client for backup
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        To avoid losing temporary or permanent access to your emails during an unplanned event (such as an outage or
        account lock), Thunderbird can sync/ backup messages from multiple accounts via IMAP and store locally on your
        primary device.

    - point: Be Careful with Mail Signatures
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        You do not know how secure of an email environment the recipient of your message may have. There are several
        extensions that automatically crawl messages, and create a detailed database of contact information based upon
        email signatures.

    - point: Be Careful with Auto-Replies
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Out-of-office automatic replies are very useful for informing people there will be a delay in replying, but all
        too often people reveal too much information- which can be used in social engineering and targeted attacks.

    - point: Choose the Right Mail Protocol
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Do not use outdated protocols (below IMAPv4 or POPv3), both have known vulnerabilities and out-dated security.

    - point: Self-Hosting
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Self-hosting your own mail server is not recommended for non-advanced users, since correctly securing it is
        critical yet requires strong networking knowledge.

    - point: Always use TLS Ports
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        There are SSL options for POP3, IMAP, and SMTP as standard TCP/IP ports. They are easy to use, and widely
        supported so should always be used instead of plaintext email ports.

    - point: DNS Availability
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers, to prevent DNS problems impacting availability- use at least 2 MX records, with
        secondary and tertiary MX records for redundancy when the primary MX record fails.

    - point: Prevent DDoS and Brute Force Attacks
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers (specifically SMTP), limit your total number of simultaneous connections, and maximum
        connection rate to reduce the impact of attempted bot attacks.

    - point: Maintain IP Blacklist
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers, you can improve spam filters and harden security, through maintaining an up-to-date
        local IP blacklist and a spam URI realtime block lists to filter out malicious hyperlinks.

  intro: ""
  checklist:
    - point: Only Use Fully End-to-End Encrypted Messengers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where messages are encrypted on your device and
        not decrypted until they reach the intended recipient. This ensures that any actor who intercepts
        traffic cannot read the message contents, nor can anybody with access to the central servers where
        data is stored.

    - point: Use only Open Source Messaging Platforms
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If code is open source then it can be independently examined and audited by anyone qualified to do
        so, to ensure that there are no backdoors, vulnerabilities, or other security issues.

    - point: Use a "Trustworthy" Messaging Platform
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When selecting an encrypted messaging app, ensure it's fully open source, stable, actively maintained,
        and ideally backed by reputable developers.

    - point: Check Security Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Enable security settings, including contact verification, security notifications, and encryption.
        Disable optional non-security features such as read receipt, last online, and typing notification.

    - point: Ensure your Recipients Environment is Secure
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Your conversation can only be as secure as the weakest link. Often the easiest way to infiltrate a
        communications channel is to target the individual or node with the least protection.

    - point: Disable Cloud Services
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Some mobile messaging apps offer a web or desktop companion. This not only increases attack surface but
        it has been linked to several critical security issues, and should therefore be avoided, if possible.

    - point: Secure Group Chats
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        The risk of compromise rises exponentially, the more participants are in a group, as the attack surface
        increases. Periodically check that all participants are legitimate.

    - point: Create a Safe Environment for Communication
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        There are several stages where your digital communications could be monitored or intercepted. This includes:
        your or your participants' device, your ISP, national gateway or government logging, the messaging provider,
        the servers.

    - point: Agree on a Communication Plan
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        In certain situations, it may be worth making a communication plan. This should include primary and backup
        methods of securely getting in hold with each other.

    - point: Strip Meta-Data from Media
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Metadata is "Data about Data" or additional information attached to a file or transaction. When you send a
        photo, audio recording, video, or document you may be revealing more than you intended to.

    - point: Defang URLs
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Sending links via various services can unintentionally expose your personal information. This is because,
        when a thumbnail or preview is generated- it happens on the client-side.

    - point: Verify your Recipient
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Always ensure you are talking to the intended recipient, and that they have not been compromised. One method
        for doing so is to use an app which supports contact verification.

    - point: Enable Ephemeral Messages
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Self-destructing messages is a feature that causes your messages to automatically delete after a set amount
        of time. This means that if your device is lost, stolen, or seized, an adversary will only have access to the
        most recent communications.

    - point: Avoid SMS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        SMS may be convenient, but it's not secure. It is susceptible to threats such as interception, sim swapping,
        manipulation, and malware.

    - point: Watch out for Trackers
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Be wary of messaging applications with trackers, as the detailed usage statistics they collect are often very
        invasive, and can sometimes reveal your identity as well as personal information that you would otherwise not
        intend to share.

    - point: Consider Jurisdiction
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The jurisdictions where the organisation is based, and data is hosted should also be taken into account.

    - point: Use an Anonymous Platform
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        If you believe you may be targeted, you should opt for an anonymous messaging platform that does not require
        a phone number, or any other personally identifiable information to sign up or use.

    - point: Ensure Forward Secrecy is Supported
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Opt for a platform that implements forward secrecy. This is where your app generates a new encryption key
        for every message.

    - point: Consider a Decentralized Platform
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        If all data flows through a central provider, you have to trust them with your data and meta-data. You cannot
        verify that the system running is authentic without back doors.

  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and give
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations,
    and that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and
    selling that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
    - point: Secure your Account
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To protect your account: use a unique
        and strong password, and enable 2-factor authentication.

    - point: Check Privacy Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure that you are comfortable with
        what data you are currently exposing and to whom.

    - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content across many social networks.
        Therefore, before uploading, posting or commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"

    - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed up by a myriad of third-party
        services, who archive this data and make it indexable and publicly available almost forever.

    - point: Don't Reveal too Much
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of data that helps them personalize
        phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).

    - point: Be Careful what you Upload
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended
        them to. This is especially relevant to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.

    - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls and spammers more munition to
        use against you, and can also allow separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.

    - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
      priority: Essential

        By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for permission to access your contacts,
        call log, location, messaging history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.

    - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke access to social apps you no longer
        use.

    - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait until you have left that place.
        This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
        building or airport.

    - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive set of additional data (called
        EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove this data before uploading.

    - point: Implement Image Cloaking

  intro: >
    This section covers how you connect your devices to the internet securely,
    including configuring your router and setting up a VPN.
  checklist:
    - point: Use a VPN
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use a reputable, paid-for VPN. This can help protect sites you visit from logging your real IP, reduce
        the amount of data your ISP can collect, and increase protection on public WiFi.

    - point: Change your Router Password
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        After getting a new router, change the password. Default router passwords are publicly available,
        meaning anyone within proximity would be able to connect.

    - point: Use WPA2, and a strong password
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        There are different authentication protocols for connecting to WiFi. Currently, the most secure options
        are WPA2 and WPA3 (on newer routers).

    - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
        sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router.

    - point: Implement a Network-Wide VPN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If you configure your VPN on your router, firewall, or home server, then traffic from all devices will
        be encrypted and routed through it, without needing individual VPN apps.

    - point: Protect against DNS leaks
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When using a VPN, it is extremely important to exclusively use the DNS server of your VPN provider or
        secure service.

    - point: Use a secure VPN Protocol
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        OpenVPN and WireGuard are open source, lightweight, and secure tunneling protocols. Avoid using PPTP
        or SSTP.

    - point: Secure DNS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between you
        and your DNS resolver.

    - point: Avoid the free router from your ISP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Typically they’re manufactured cheaply in bulk in China, with insecure propriety firmware that doesn't
        receive regular security updates.

    - point: Whitelist MAC Addresses
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You can whitelist MAC addresses in your router settings, disallowing any unknown devices to immediately
        connect to your network, even if they know your credentials.

    - point: Change the Router’s Local IP Address
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        It is possible for a malicious script in your web browser to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability,
        accessing known-vulnerable routers at their local IP address and tampering with them.

    - point: Don't Reveal Personal Info in SSID
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You should update your network name, choosing an SSID that does not identify you, include your flat
        number/address, and does not specify the device brand/model.

    - point: Opt-Out Router Listings
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        WiFi SSIDs are scanned, logged, and then published on various websites, which is a serious privacy
        concern for some.

    - point: Hide your SSID
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Your router's Service Set Identifier is simply the network name. If it is not visible, it may receive
        less abuse.

    - point: Disable WPS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides an easier method to connect, without entering a long WiFi password, but
        WPS introduces a series of major security issues.

    - point: Disable UPnP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Universal Plug and Play allows applications to automatically forward a port on your router, but it has
        a long history of serious security issues.

    - point: Use a Guest Network for Guests
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Do not grant access to your primary WiFi network to visitors, as it enables them to interact with other
        devices on the network.

    - point: Change your Router's Default IP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Modifying your router admin panel's default IP address will make it more difficult for malicious scripts
        targeting local IP addresses.

    - point: Kill unused processes and services on your router
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Services like Telnet and SSH that provide command-line access to devices should never be exposed to the
        internet and should also be disabled on the local network unless they're actually needed.

    - point: Don't have Open Ports
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Close any open ports on your router that are not needed. Open ports provide an easy entrance for hackers.

    - point: Disable Unused Remote Access Protocols
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When protocols such as PING, Telnet, SSH, UPnP, and HNAP etc are enabled, they allow your router to be
        probed from anywhere in the world.

    - point: Disable Cloud-Based Management
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You should treat your router's admin panel with the utmost care, as considerable damage can be caused
        if an attacker is able to gain access.

    - point: Manage Range Correctly
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        It's common to want to pump your router's range to the max, but if you reside in a smaller flat, your
        attack surface is increased when your WiFi network can be picked up across the street.

    - point: Route all traffic through [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor)
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        VPNs have their weaknesses. For increased security, route all your internet traffic through the [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor)
        network.

    - point: Disable WiFi on all Devices
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Connecting to even a secure WiFi network increases your attack surface. Disabling your home WiFi and
        connect each device via Ethernet.

#   description: Reduce invasive tracking for cells, smartphones and tablets
#   icon: mobile
#   intro: >
#     Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world
#     to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication,
#     entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
#     to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.

#     Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over
#     who has this data- your phone is even able to
#     [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371).
#     Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your
#     phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html),
#     and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent.
#     And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

#     Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you
#     intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions.
#     It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about
#     us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend
#     what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

#     This data is used for
#     [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) -
#     more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment.
#     Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

#     More of us are concerned about how
#     [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/),
#     and rightly so, federal agencies often
#     [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
#     [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
#     Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are
#     made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence,
#     [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).
#     And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.

  intro: >
    Although Windows and OS X are easy to use and convenient, they both are far from secure.
    Your OS provides the interface between hardware and your applications, so if
    compromised can have detrimental effects.
  checklist:
    - point: Keep your System up-to-date
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        System updates contain fixes/patches for security issues, improve performance, and sometimes add new
        features. Install new updates when prompted.

    - point: Encrypt your Device
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use BitLocker for Windows, FileVault on MacOS, or LUKS on Linux, to enable full disk encryption. This
        prevents unauthorized access if your computer is lost or stolen.

    - point: Backup Important Data
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Maintaining encrypted backups prevents loss due to ransomware, theft, or damage. Consider using

        security.

    - point: Power Off Computer, instead of Standby
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Shut down your device when not in use, especially if your disk is encrypted, to keep data secure.

    - point: Don't link your PC with your Microsoft or Apple Account

  description: Using IoT devices without compromising your privacy
  icon: home
  intro: >-
    Home assistants (such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri) and other internet connected
    devices collect large amounts of personal data (including voice samples, location data,
    home details and logs of all interactions). Since you have limited control on what is
    being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to
    recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.

    Security vs Privacy: There are many smart devices on the market that claim to increase
    the security of your home while being easy and convenient to use (Such as Smart Burglar
    Alarms, Internet Security Cameras, Smart Locks and Remote access Doorbells to name a few).
    These devices may appear to make security easier, but there is a trade-off in terms of
    privacy: as they collect large amounts of personal data, and leave you without control
    over how this is stored or used. The security of these devices is also questionable,
    since many of them can be (and are being) hacked, allowing an intruder to bypass
    detection with minimum effort.

    The most privacy-respecting option, would be to not use "smart" internet-connected
    devices in your home, and not to rely on a security device that requires an internet
    connection. But if you do, it is important to fully understand the risks of any given
    product, before buying it. Then adjust settings to increase privacy and security.
    The following checklist will help mitigate the risks associated with
    internet-connected home devices.

    Credit card fraud is the most common form of identity theft (with [133,015 reports in the
    US in 2017 alone](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/)),
    and a total loss of $905 million, which was a 26% increase from the previous year.
    The with a median amount lost per person was $429 in 2017.
    It's more important than ever to take basic steps to protect yourself from falling victim

    Note about credit cards: Credit cards have technological methods in place to
    detect and stop some fraudulent transactions. Major payment processors implement
    this, by mining huge amounts of data from their card holders, in order to know
    a great deal about each persons spending habits. This data is used to identify
    fraud, but is also sold onto other data brokers. Credit cards are therefore good
    for security, but terrible for data privacy.

      details: Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy, by blocking the
        trackers that ads implement. [uBlock
        Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin)
        is a very efficient and open source browser addon, developed by Raymond
        Hill. When 3rd-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the
        ability to track you, gathering personal information about you and your
        habits, which can then be sold, or used to show you more targeted ads,
        and some ads are plain malicious or fake. Blocking ads also makes pages
        load faster, uses less data and provides a less cluttered experience.

      details: "It may sound obvious, but when you logging into any online accounts,
        double check the URL is correct. Storing commonly visited sites in your
        bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When visiting
        new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: Browser
        warnings, redirects, on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a
        website using a tool, such as: [Virus
        Total](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/virus-to\

      details: "Your system or browser can be compromised by spyware, miners, browser
        hijackers, malicious redirects, adware etc. You can usually stay
        protected, just by: ignoring pop-ups, be wary of what your clicking,
        don't proceed to a website if your browser warns you it may be
        malicious. Common signs of browser malware include: default search
        engine or homepage has been modified, toolbars, unfamiliar extensions or
        icons, significantly more ads, errors and pages loading much slower than
        usual. These articles from Heimdal explain [signs of browser

        (with a few tweaks) and
        [Brave](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/brave-browser)
        are secure, private-respecting browsers. Both are fast, open source,
        user-friendly and available on all major operating systems. Your browser
        has access to everything that you do online, so if possible, avoid
        Google Chrome, Edge and Safari as (without correct configuration) all
        three of them, collect usage data, call home and allow for invasive
        tracking. Firefox requires a few changes to achieve optimal security,
        for example - [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki) or
        [12byte](https://12bytes.org/firefox-configuration-guide-for-privacy-fr\

    - point: Perform Pre-Integration Testing (Standard)
      priority: Essential
      details: Using a privacy-preserving, non-tracking search engine, will reduce
        risk that your search terms are not logged, or used against you.
        Consider
        [DuckDuckGo](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/duckduckgo),
        or [Qwant](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/qwant).
        Google implements some [incredibly
        invasive](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea)
        tracking policies, and have a history of displaying [biased search
        results](https://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-that-google-search-results-are-biased-2014-10).
        Therefore Google, along with Bing, Baidu, Yahoo and Yandex are
        incompatible with anyone looking to protect their privacy. It is
        recommended to update your [browsers default
        search](https://duckduckgo.com/install) to a privacy-respecting search
        engine.
    - point: Perform SW Integration Tests (CS)
      priority: Essential
      details: Extensions are able to see, log or modify anything you do in the
        browser, and some innocent looking browser apps, have malicious
        intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed, and
        may use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/
        track you. Both
        [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox) and
        Chrome web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an
        extension requires before you install it. Check the reviews. Only
        install extensions you really need, and removed those which you haven't
        used in a while.

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and
    give people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and
    share. Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction
    and bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking
    Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations, and
    that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and selling
    that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
    - point: Secure your Account
      priority: Essential
      details: "Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To
        protect your account: use a unique and strong password, and enable
        2-factor authentication."
    - point: Check Privacy Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure
        that you are comfortable with what data you are currently exposing and
        to whom.
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
      priority: Essential
      details: There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content
        across many social networks. Therefore, before uploading, posting or
        commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
      priority: Essential
      details: Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed
        up by a myriad of third-party services, who archive this data and make
        it indexable and publicly available almost forever.
    - point: Don't Reveal too Much
      priority: Essential
      details: Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of
        data that helps them personalize phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much
        detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).
    - point: Be Careful what you Upload
      priority: Essential
      details: Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally
        reveal a lot more than you intended them to. This is especially relevant
        to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.
    - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
      priority: Essential
      details: Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls
        and spammers more munition to use against you, and can also allow
        separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.
    - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
      priority: Essential
      details: By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for
        permission to access your contacts, call log, location, messaging
        history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.
    - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
      priority: Essential
      details: Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke
        access to social apps you no longer use.
    - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
      priority: Essential
      details: If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait
        until you have left that place. This is particularly important when you
        are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
        building or airport.
    - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
      priority: Optional
      details: Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive
        set of additional data (called EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove
        this data before uploading.
    - point: Implement Image Cloaking
      priority: Advanced
      details: Tools like Fawkes can be used to very subtly, slightly change the
        structure of faces within photos in a way that is imperceptible by
        humans, but will prevent facial recognition systems from being able to
        recognize a given face.
    - point: Consider Spoofing GPS in home vicinity
      priority: Advanced
      details: Even if you yourself never use social media, there is always going to
        be others who are not as careful, and could reveal your location.
    - point: Consider False Information
      priority: Advanced
      details: If you just want to read, and do not intend on posting too much-
        consider using an alias name, and false contact details.
    - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
      priority: Advanced
      details: Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online
        security and privacy, avoid using any mainstream social networks.

    of the OS to each application,  thereby keeping each application isolated
    from all others on the server. Each application can only see and  affect
    itself. Recently, OS virtualization has become increasingly popular due to
    advances in its ease of  use and a greater focus on developer agility as a
    key benefit. Today’s OS virtualization technologies are  primarily focused
    on providing a portable, reusable, and automatable way to package and run
    applications (apps). The terms application container or simply container are
    frequently used to refer to these technologies.

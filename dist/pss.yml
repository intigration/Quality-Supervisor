  intro: Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default or
    stolen passwords
  checklist:
    - point: Legal and regulatory requirements involving AI are understood, managed,
        and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        AI systems may be subject to specific applicable legal and
        regulatory requirements. Some legal requirements can mandate (e.g.,
        nondiscrimination, data privacy and security controls) documentation,
        disclosure, and increased AI system transparency. These requirements are
        complex and may not be applicable or differ across applications and
        contexts. 
        
        For example, AI system testing processes for bias measurement, such as disparate impact, are not applied uniformly within the legal context. Disparate impact is broadly defined as a facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately harms a group based on a protected trait. Notably, some modeling algorithms or debiasing techniques that rely on demographic information, could also come into tension with legal prohibitions on disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination).


        Additionally, some intended users of AI systems may not have consistent or reliable access to fundamental internet technologies (a phenomenon widely described as the “digital divide”) or may experience difficulties interacting with AI systems due to disabilities or impairments. Such factors may mean different communities experience bias or other negative impacts when trying to access AI systems. Failure to address such design issues may pose legal risks, for example in employment related activities affecting persons with disabilities.
    - point: The characteristics of trustworthy AI are integrated into organizational
        policies, processes, and procedures.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Policies, processes, and procedures are central components of
        effective AI risk management and fundamental to individual and
        organizational accountability. All stakeholders benefit from policies,
        processes, and procedures which require preventing harm by design and
        default. 


        Organizational policies and procedures will vary based on available resources and risk profiles, but can help systematize AI actor roles and responsibilities throughout the AI lifecycle. Without such policies, risk management can be subjective across the organization, and exacerbate rather than minimize risks over time.  Polices, or summaries thereof, are understandable to relevant AI actors. Policies reflect an understanding of the underlying metrics, measurements, and tests that are necessary to support policy and AI system design, development, deployment and use.


        Lack of clear information about responsibilities and chains of command will limit the effectiveness of risk management.
    - point: Processes and procedures are in place to determine the needed level of
        risk management activities based on the organization's risk tolerance.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Risk management resources are finite in any organization. Adequate
        AI governance policies delineate the mapping, measurement, and
        prioritization of risks to allocate resources toward the most material
        issues for an AI system to ensure effective risk management. Policies may
        specify systematic processes for assigning mapped and measured risks to
        standardized risk scales. 


        AI risk tolerances  range from negligible to critical – from, respectively, almost no risk to risks that can result in irredeemable human, reputational, financial, or environmental losses. Risk tolerance rating policies consider different sources of risk, (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, or model risks). A typical risk measurement approach entails the multiplication, or qualitative combination, of measured or estimated impact and likelihood of impacts into a risk score (risk ≈ impact x likelihood). This score is then placed on a risk scale. Scales for risk may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches. Impact assessments are a common tool for understanding the severity of mapped risks. In the most fulsome AI risk management approaches, all models are assigned to a risk level.
    - point: The risk management process and its outcomes are established through
        transparent policies, procedures, and other controls based on
        organizational risk priorities.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Clear policies and procedures relating to documentation and
        transparency facilitate and enhance efforts  to communicate roles and
        responsibilities for the Map, Measure and Manage functions across the AI
        lifecycle. Standardized documentation can help organizations
        systematically integrate AI risk management processes and enhance
        accountability efforts. For example, by adding their contact information
        to a work product document, AI actors can improve communication, increase
        ownership of work products, and potentially enhance consideration of
        product quality. Documentation may generate downstream benefits related to
        improved system replicability and robustness. Proper documentation storage
        and access procedures allow for quick retrieval of critical information
        during a negative incident. Explainable machine learning efforts (models
        and explanatory methods) may bolster technical documentation practices by
        introducing additional information for review and interpretation by AI
        Actors.
    - point: Ongoing monitoring and periodic review of the risk management process and
        its outcomes are planned, organizational roles and responsibilities are
        clearly defined, including determining the frequency of periodic review.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        AI systems are dynamic and may perform in unexpected ways once
        deployed or after deployment. Continuous monitoring is a risk management
        process for tracking unexpected issues and performance changes, in
        real-time or at a specific frequency, across the AI system lifecycle.


        Incident response and “appeal and override” are commonly used processes in information technology management. These processes enable real-time flagging of potential incidents, and human adjudication of system outcomes.


        Establishing and maintaining incident response plans can reduce the likelihood of additive impacts during an AI incident. Smaller organizations which may not have fulsome governance programs, can utilize incident response plans for addressing system failures, abuse or misuse.
    - point: Mechanisms are in place to inventory AI systems and are resourced
        according to organizational risk priorities.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        An AI system inventory is an organized database of artifacts
        relating to an AI system or model. It may include system documentation,
        incident response plans, data dictionaries, links to implementation
        software or source code, names and contact information for relevant AI
        actors, or other information that may be helpful for model or system
        maintenance and incident response purposes. AI system inventories also
        enable a holistic view of organizational AI assets. A serviceable AI
        system inventory may allow for the quick resolution of:


        - specific queries for single models, such as  “when was this model last refreshed?” 

        - high-level queries across all models, such as, “how many models are currently deployed within our organization?” or “how many users are impacted by our models?” 


        AI system inventories are a common element of traditional model risk management approaches and can provide technical, business and risk management benefits. Typically inventories capture all organizational models or systems, as partial inventories may not provide the value of a full inventory.
    - point: Processes and procedures are in place for decommissioning and phasing out
        of AI systems safely and in a manner that does not increase risks or
        decrease the organization’s trustworthiness.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Irregular or indiscriminate termination or deletion of models or AI
        systems may be inappropriate and increase organizational risk. For
        example, AI systems may be subject to regulatory requirements or
        implicated in future security or legal investigations. To maintain trust,
        organizations may consider establishing policies and processes for the
        systematic and deliberate decommissioning of AI systems. Typically, such
        policies consider user and community concerns, risks in dependent and
        linked systems, and security, legal or regulatory concerns. Decommissioned
        models or systems may be stored in a model inventory along with active
        models,  for an established length  of time.
    - point: Roles and responsibilities and lines of communication related to mapping,
        measuring, and managing AI risks are documented and are clear to
        individuals and teams throughout the organization.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The development of a risk-aware organizational culture starts with
        defining responsibilities. For example, under some risk management
        structures, professionals carrying out test and evaluation  tasks are
        independent from AI system developers and report through risk management
        functions or directly to executives.  This kind of structure may help
        counter implicit biases such as groupthink or sunk cost fallacy and
        bolster risk management functions, so efforts are not  easily bypassed or
        ignored.


        Instilling a culture where AI system design and implementation decisions can be questioned and course- corrected by empowered AI actors can enhance organizations’ abilities to anticipate and effectively manage risks before they become ingrained.
    - point: The organization’s personnel and partners receive AI risk management
        training to enable them to perform their duties and responsibilities
        consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        To enhance AI risk management adoption and effectiveness,
        organizations are encouraged to identify and integrate appropriate
        training curricula into enterprise learning requirements. Through regular
        training, AI actors can maintain awareness of:


        - AI risk management goals and their role in achieving them.

        - Organizational policies, applicable laws and regulations, and industry best practices and norms.


        See [MAP 3.4]() and [3.5]() for additional relevant information.
    - point: Executive leadership of the organization takes responsibility for
        decisions about risks associated with AI system development and
        deployment.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Senior leadership and members of the C-Suite in organizations that
        maintain an AI portfolio, should maintain awareness of AI risks, affirm
        the organizational appetite for such risks, and be responsible for
        managing those risks..


        Accountability ensures that a specific team and individual is responsible for AI risk management efforts. Some organizations grant authority and resources (human and budgetary) to a designated officer who ensures adequate performance of the institution’s AI portfolio (e.g. predictive modeling, machine learning).
    - point: Decision-makings related to mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks
        throughout the lifecycle is informed by a diverse team (e.g., diversity of
        demographics, disciplines, experience, expertise, and backgrounds).
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A diverse team that includes AI actors with diversity of
        experience, disciplines, and backgrounds to enhance organizational
        capacity and capability for anticipating risks is better equipped to carry
        out risk management. Consultation with external personnel may be necessary
        when internal teams lack a diverse range of lived experiences or
        disciplinary expertise.


        To extend the benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion to both the users and AI actors, it is recommended that teams are composed of a diverse group of individuals who reflect a range of backgrounds, perspectives and expertise.


        Without commitment from senior leadership, beneficial aspects of team diversity and inclusion can be overridden by unstated organizational incentives that inadvertently conflict with the broader values of a diverse workforce.
    - point: Policies and procedures are in place to define and differentiate roles
        and responsibilities for human-AI configurations and oversight of AI
        systems.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Identifying and managing AI risks and impacts are enhanced when a
        broad set of perspectives and actors across the AI lifecycle, including
        technical, legal, compliance, social science, and human factors expertise
        is engaged. AI actors include those who operate, use, or interact with AI
        systems for downstream tasks, or monitor AI system performance. Effective
        risk management efforts include:


        - clear definitions and differentiation of the various human roles and responsibilities for AI system oversight and governance

        - recognizing and clarifying differences between AI system overseers and those using or interacting with AI systems.
    - point: Organizational policies, and practices are in place to foster a critical
        thinking and safety-first mindset in the design, development, deployment,
        and uses of AI systems to minimize negative impacts.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A risk culture and accompanying practices can help organizations
        effectively triage the most critical risks. Organizations in some
        industries implement three (or more) “lines of defense,” where separate
        teams are held accountable for different aspects of the system lifecycle,
        such as development, risk management, and auditing. While a traditional
        three-lines approach may be impractical for smaller organizations,
        leadership can commit to cultivating a strong risk culture through other
        means. For example, “effective challenge,” is a culture- based practice
        that encourages critical thinking and questioning of important design and
        implementation decisions by experts with the authority and stature to make
        such changes.


        Red-teaming is another risk measurement and management approach. This practice consists of adversarial testing of AI systems under stress conditions to seek out failure modes or vulnerabilities in the system. Red-teams are composed of external experts or personnel who are independent from internal AI actors.
    - point: Organizational teams document the risks and potential impacts of the AI
        technology they design, develop, deploy, evaluate and use, and communicate
        about the impacts more broadly.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Impact assessments are one approach for driving responsible
        technology development practices. And, within a specific use case, these
        assessments can provide a high-level structure for organizations to frame
        risks of a given algorithm or deployment. Impact assessments can also
        serve as a mechanism for organizations to articulate risks and generate
        documentation for managing and oversight activities when harms do arise.


        Impact assessments may:


        - be applied at the beginning of a process but also iteratively and regularly since goals and outcomes can evolve over time. 

        - include perspectives from AI actors, including operators, users, and potentially impacted communities (including historically marginalized communities, those with disabilities, and individuals impacted by the digital divide), 

        - assist in “go/no-go” decisions for an AI system. 

        - consider conflicts of interest, or undue influence, related to the organizational team being assessed.


        See the MAP function playbook guidance for more information relating to impact assessments.
    - point: Organizational practices are in place to enable AI testing,
        identification of incidents, and information sharing.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Identifying AI system limitations, detecting and tracking negative
        impacts and incidents, and sharing information about these issues with
        appropriate AI actors will improve risk management. Issues such as concept
        drift, AI bias and discrimination, shortcut learning or underspecification
        are difficult to identify using current standard AI testing processes.
        Organizations can institute in-house use and testing policies and
        procedures to identify and manage such issues. Efforts can take the form
        of pre-alpha or pre-beta testing, or deploying internally developed
        systems or products within the organization. Testing may entail limited
        and controlled in-house, or publicly available, AI system testbeds, and
        accessibility of AI system interfaces and outputs.


        Without policies and procedures that enable consistent testing practices, risk management efforts may be bypassed or ignored, exacerbating risks or leading to inconsistent risk management activities.


        Information sharing about impacts or incidents detected during testing or deployment can:


        * draw attention to AI system risks, failures, abuses or misuses, 

        * allow organizations to benefit from insights based on a wide range of AI applications and implementations, and 

        * allow organizations to be more proactive in avoiding known failure modes.


        Organizations may consider sharing incident information with the AI Incident Database, the AIAAIC, users, impacted communities, or with traditional cyber vulnerability databases, such as the MITRE CVE list.
    - point: Organizational policies and practices are in place to collect, consider,
        prioritize, and integrate feedback from those external to the team that
        developed or deployed the AI system regarding the potential individual and
        societal impacts related to AI risks.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Beyond internal and laboratory-based system testing, organizational
        policies and practices may consider AI system fitness-for-purpose related
        to the intended context of use.


        Participatory stakeholder engagement is one type of qualitative activity to help AI actors answer questions such as whether to pursue a project or how to design with impact in mind. This type of feedback, with domain expert input, can also assist AI actors to identify emergent scenarios and risks in certain AI applications. The consideration of when and how to convene a group and the kinds of individuals, groups, or community organizations to include is an iterative process connected to the system's purpose and its level of risk. Other factors relate to how to collaboratively and respectfully capture stakeholder feedback and insight that is useful, without being a solely perfunctory exercise.


        These activities are best carried out by personnel with expertise in participatory practices, qualitative methods, and translation of contextual feedback for technical audiences.


        Participatory engagement is not a one-time exercise and is best carried out from the very beginning of AI system commissioning through the end of the lifecycle. Organizations can consider how to incorporate engagement when beginning a project and as part of their monitoring of systems. Engagement is often utilized as a consultative practice, but this perspective may inadvertently lead to “participation washing.” Organizational transparency about the purpose and goal of the engagement can help mitigate that possibility.


        Organizations may also consider targeted consultation with subject matter experts as a complement to participatory findings. Experts may assist internal staff in identifying and conceptualizing potential negative impacts that were previously not considered.
    - point: Mechanisms are established to enable AI actors to regularly incorporate
        adjudicated feedback from relevant AI actors into system design and
        implementation.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Organizational policies and procedures that equip AI actors with
        the processes, knowledge, and expertise needed to inform collaborative
        decisions about system deployment improve risk management. These decisions
        are closely tied to AI systems and organizational risk tolerance.


        Risk tolerance, established by organizational leadership, reflects the level and type of risk the organization will accept while conducting its mission and carrying out its strategy. When risks arise, resources are allocated based on the assessed risk of a given AI system. Organizations typically apply a risk tolerance approach where higher risk systems receive larger allocations of risk management resources and lower risk systems receive less resources.
    - point: Policies and procedures are in place that address AI risks associated
        with third-party entities, including risks of infringement of a third
        party’s intellectual property or other rights.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Risk measurement and management can be complicated by how customers
        use or integrate third-party data or systems into AI products or services,
        particularly without sufficient internal governance structures and
        technical safeguards. 


        Organizations usually engage multiple third parties for external expertise, data, software packages (both open source and commercial), and software and hardware platforms across the AI lifecycle. This engagement has beneficial uses and can increase complexities of risk management efforts.


        Organizational approaches to managing third-party (positive and negative) risk may be tailored to the resources, risk profile, and use case for each system. Organizations can apply governance approaches to third-party AI systems and data as they would for internal resources — including open source software, publicly available data, and commercially available models.
    - point: Contingency processes are in place to handle failures or incidents in
        third-party data or AI systems deemed to be high-risk.
      priority: Advanced
      details: To mitigate the potential harms of third-party system failures,
        organizations may implement policies and procedures that include
        redundancies for covering third-party functions.
    - point: A determination is made as to whether the AI system achieves its intended
        purpose and stated objectives and whether its development or deployment
        should proceed.
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI systems may not necessarily be the right solution for a given
        business task or problem. A standard risk management practice is to
        formally weigh an AI system’s negative risks against its benefits, and to
        determine if the AI system is an  appropriate solution. Tradeoffs among
        trustworthiness characteristics —such as deciding to deploy a system based
        on system performance vs system transparency–may require regular
        assessment throughout the AI lifecycle.
    - point: Treatment of documented AI risks is prioritized based on impact,
        likelihood, or available resources or methods.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Risk refers to the composite measure of an event’s probability of
        occurring and the magnitude (or degree) of the consequences of the
        corresponding events. The impacts, or consequences, of AI systems can be
        positive, negative, or both and can result in opportunities or risks.  


        Organizational risk tolerances are often informed by several internal and external factors, including existing industry practices, organizational values, and legal or regulatory requirements. Since risk management resources are often limited, organizations usually assign them based on risk tolerance. AI risks that are deemed more serious receive more oversight attention and risk management resources.
    - point: Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority as identified by the Map
        function, are developed, planned, and documented. Risk response options
        can include mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Outcomes from GOVERN-1, MAP-5 and MEASURE-2, can be used to address
        and document identified risks based on established risk tolerances.
        Organizations can follow existing regulations and guidelines for risk
        criteria, tolerances and responses established by organizational, domain,
        discipline, sector, or professional requirements. In lieu of such
        guidance, organizations can develop risk response plans based on
        strategies such as accepted model risk management, enterprise risk
        management, and information sharing and disclosure practices.
    - point: Negative residual risks (defined as the sum of all unmitigated risks) to
        both downstream acquirers of AI systems and end users are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Organizations may choose to accept or transfer some of the
        documented risks  from MAP and MANAGE 1.3 and 2.1.  Such risks, known as
        residual risk, may affect downstream AI actors such as those engaged in
        system procurement or use. Transparent monitoring and managing residual
        risks enables cost benefit analysis and the examination of potential
        values of AI systems versus its potential negative impacts.
    - point: Resources required to manage AI risks are taken into account, along with
        viable non-AI alternative systems, approaches, or methods – to reduce the
        magnitude or likelihood of potential impacts.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Organizational risk response may entail identifying and analyzing
        alternative approaches, methods, processes or systems, and balancing
        tradeoffs between trustworthiness characteristics and how they relate to
        organizational principles and societal values. Analysis of these tradeoffs
        is informed by consulting with interdisciplinary organizational teams,
        independent domain experts, and engaging with individuals or community
        groups. These processes require sufficient resource allocation.
    - point: Mechanisms are in place and applied to sustain the value of deployed AI
        systems.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        System performance and trustworthiness may evolve and shift over
        time, once an AI system is deployed and put into operation. This
        phenomenon, generally known as drift, can degrade the value of the AI
        system to the organization and increase the likelihood of negative
        impacts.  Regular monitoring of AI systems’ performance and
        trustworthiness enhances organizations’ ability to detect and respond to
        drift, and thus sustain an AI system’s value once deployed. Processes and
        mechanisms for regular monitoring address system functionality and
        behavior - as well as impacts and alignment with the values and norms
        within the specific context of use. For example, considerations regarding
        impacts on personal or public safety or privacy may include limiting high
        speeds when operating autonomous vehicles or restricting illicit content
        recommendations for minors. 


        Regular monitoring activities can enable organizations to systematically and proactively identify emergent risks and respond according to established protocols and metrics.  Options for organizational responses include 1) avoiding the risk, 2)accepting the risk, 3) mitigating the risk, or 4) transferring the risk. Each of these actions require planning and resources. Organizations are encouraged to establish risk management protocols with consideration of the trustworthiness characteristics, the deployment context, and real world impacts.
    - point: Procedures are followed to respond to and recover from a previously
        unknown risk when it is identified.
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI systems – like any technology – can demonstrate
        non-functionality or failure or unexpected and unusual behavior. They also
        can be subject to attacks, incidents, or other misuse or abuse – which
        their sources are not always known apriori. Organizations can establish,
        document, communicate and maintain treatment procedures to recognize and
        counter, mitigate and manage risks that were not previously identified.
    - point: Mechanisms are in place and applied, responsibilities are assigned and
        understood to supersede, disengage, or deactivate AI systems that
        demonstrate performance or outcomes inconsistent with intended use.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Performance inconsistent with intended use does not always increase
        risk or lead to negative impacts. Rigorous TEVV practices are useful for
        protecting against negative impacts regardless of intended use. When
        negative impacts do arise, superseding (bypassing), disengaging, or
        deactivating/decommissioning a model, AI system component(s), or the
        entire AI system may be necessary, such as when: 


        - a system reaches the end of its lifetime

        - detected or identified risks exceed tolerance thresholds

        - adequate system mitigation actions are beyond the organization’s capacity

        - feasible system mitigation actions do not meet regulatory, legal, norms or standards. 

        - impending risk is detected during continual monitoring, for which feasible mitigation cannot be identified or implemented in a timely fashion. 


        Safely removing AI systems from operation, either temporarily or permanently, under these scenarios requires standard protocols that minimize operational disruption and downstream negative impacts. Protocols can involve redundant or backup systems that are developed in alignment with established system governance policies (see GOVERN 1.7), regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, business requirements and norms and l standards within the application context of use. Decision thresholds and metrics for actions to bypass or deactivate system components are part of continual monitoring procedures. Incidents that result in a bypass/deactivate decision require documentation and review to understand root causes, impacts, and potential opportunities for mitigation and redeployment. Organizations are encouraged to develop risk and change management protocols that consider and anticipate upstream and downstream consequences of both temporary and/or permanent decommissioning, and provide contingency options.
    - point: AI risks and benefits from third-party resources are regularly monitored,
        and risk controls are applied and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI systems may depend on external resources and associated
        processes, including third-party data, software or hardware systems. Third
        parties’ supplying organizations with components and services, including
        tools, software, and expertise for AI system design, development,
        deployment or use can improve efficiency and scalability. It can also
        increase complexity and opacity, and, in-turn, risk. Documenting
        third-party technologies, personnel, and resources that were employed can
        help manage risks. Focusing first and foremost on risks involving physical
        safety, legal liabilities, regulatory compliance, and negative impacts on
        individuals, groups, or society is recommended.
    - point: Pre-trained models which are used for development are monitored as part
        of AI system regular  monitoring and maintenance.
      priority: Advanced
      details: A common approach in AI development is transfer learning, whereby
        an existing pre-trained model is adapted for use in a different, but
        related application. AI actors in development tasks often use pre-trained
        models from third-party entities for tasks such as image classification,
        language prediction, and entity recognition, because the resources to
        build such models may not be readily available to most organizations.
        Pre-trained models are typically trained to address various classification
        or prediction problems, using exceedingly large datasets and
        computationally intensive resources. The use of pre-trained models can
        make it difficult to anticipate negative system outcomes or impacts. Lack
        of documentation or transparency tools increases the difficulty and
        general complexity when deploying pre-trained models and hinders root
        cause analyses.
    - point: Post-deployment AI system monitoring plans are implemented, including
        mechanisms for capturing and evaluating input from users and other
        relevant AI actors, appeal and override, decommissioning, incident
        response, recovery, and change management.
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI system performance and trustworthiness can change due to a
        variety of factors. Regular AI system monitoring can help deployers
        identify performance degradations, adversarial attacks, unexpected and
        unusual behavior, near-misses, and impacts. Including pre- and
        post-deployment external feedback about AI system performance can enhance
        organizational awareness about positive and negative impacts, and reduce
        the time to respond to risks and harms.
    - point: Measurable activities for continual improvements are integrated into AI
        system updates and include regular engagement with interested parties,
        including relevant AI actors.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Regular monitoring processes enable system updates to enhance
        performance and functionality in accordance with regulatory and legal
        frameworks, and organizational and contextual values and norms. These
        processes also facilitate analyses of root causes, system degradation,
        drift, near-misses, and failures, and incident response and
        documentation. 


        AI actors across the lifecycle have many opportunities to capture and incorporate external feedback about system performance, limitations, and impacts, and implement continuous improvements. Improvements may not always be to model pipeline or system processes, and may instead be based on metrics beyond accuracy or other quality performance measures. In these cases, improvements may entail adaptations to business or organizational procedures or practices. Organizations are encouraged to develop improvements that will maintain traceability and transparency for developers, end users, auditors, and relevant AI actors.
    - point: Incidents and errors are communicated to relevant AI actors including
        affected communities. Processes for tracking, responding to, and
        recovering from incidents and errors are followed and documented.

      details: >-
        Regularly documenting an accurate and transparent account of
        identified and reported errors can enhance AI risk management activities.,
        Examples include:


        - how errors were identified, 

        - incidents related to the error, 

        - whether the error has been repaired, and

        - how repairs can be distributed to all impacted stakeholders and users.
    - point: "Intended purpose, potentially beneficial uses, context-specific laws,
        norms and expectations, and prospective settings in which the AI system
        will be deployed are understood and documented. Considerations include:
        specific set or types of users along with their expectations; potential
        positive and negative impacts of system uses to individuals, communities,
        organizations, society, and the planet; assumptions and related
        limitations about AI system purposes; uses and risks across the
        development or product AI lifecycle; TEVV and system metrics."
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Highly accurate and optimized systems can cause harm. Relatedly,
        organizations should expect broadly deployed AI tools to be reused,
        repurposed, and potentially misused regardless of intentions. 


        AI actors can work collaboratively, and with external parties such as community groups, to help delineate the bounds of acceptable deployment, consider preferable alternatives, and identify principles and strategies to manage likely risks. Context mapping is the first step in this effort, and may include examination of the following: 


        * intended purpose and impact of system use. 

        * concept of operations. 

        * intended, prospective, and actual deployment setting. 

        * requirements for system deployment and operation. 

        * end user and operator expectations. 

        * specific set or types of end users. 

        * potential negative impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society – or context-specific impacts such as legal requirements or impacts to the environment. 

        * unanticipated, downstream, or other unknown contextual factors.

        * how AI system changes connect to impacts. 


        These types of processes can assist AI actors in understanding how limitations, constraints, and other realities associated with the deployment and use of AI technology can create impacts once they are deployed or operate in the real world. When coupled with the enhanced organizational culture resulting from the established policies and procedures in the Govern function, the Map function can provide opportunities to foster and instill new perspectives, activities, and skills for approaching risks and impacts. 


        Context mapping also includes discussion and consideration of non-AI or  non-technology alternatives especially as related to whether the given context is narrow enough to manage AI and its potential negative impacts. Non-AI alternatives may include capturing and evaluating information using semi-autonomous or mostly-manual methods.
    - point: Inter-disciplinary AI actors, competencies, skills and capacities for
        establishing context reflect demographic diversity and broad domain and
        user experience expertise, and their participation is documented.
        Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration are prioritized.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Successfully mapping context requires a team of AI actors with a
        diversity of experience, expertise, abilities and backgrounds, and with
        the resources and independence to engage in critical inquiry.


        Having a diverse team contributes to more  broad and open sharing of ideas and assumptions about the purpose and function of the technology being designed and developed – making these implicit aspects more explicit. The benefit of a diverse staff in managing AI risks is not the beliefs or presumed beliefs of individual workers, but the behavior that results from a collective perspective. An environment which fosters critical inquiry creates opportunities to surface problems and identify existing and emergent risks.
    - point: The organization’s mission and relevant goals for the AI technology are
        understood and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Defining and documenting the specific business purpose of an AI
        system in a broader context of societal values helps teams to evaluate
        risks and increases the clarity of “go/no-go” decisions about whether to
        deploy.


        Trustworthy AI technologies may present a demonstrable business benefit beyond implicit or explicit costs, provide added value, and don't lead to wasted resources. Organizations can feel confident in performing risk avoidance if the implicit or explicit risks outweigh the advantages of AI systems,  and  not implementing an AI solution whose risks surpass potential benefits.


        For example, making AI systems more equitable can result in better managed risk, and can help enhance consideration of the business value of making inclusively designed, accessible and more equitable AI systems.
    - point: The business value or context of business use has been clearly defined or
        – in the case of assessing existing AI systems – re-evaluated.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Socio-technical AI risks emerge from the interplay between
        technical development decisions and how a system is used, who operates it,
        and the social context into which it is deployed. Addressing these risks
        is complex and requires a commitment to understanding how contextual
        factors may interact with AI lifecycle actions. One such contextual factor
        is how organizational mission and identified system purpose create
        incentives within AI system design, development, and deployment tasks that
        may result in positive and negative impacts. By establishing comprehensive
        and explicit enumeration of AI systems’ context of of business use and
        expectations, organizations can identify and manage these types of risks.
    - point: Organizational risk tolerances are determined and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Risk tolerance reflects the level and type of risk the organization
        is willing to accept while conducting its mission and carrying out its
        strategy.


        Organizations can follow existing regulations and guidelines for risk criteria, tolerance and response established by organizational, domain, discipline, sector, or professional requirements. Some sectors or industries may have established definitions of harm or may have established documentation, reporting, and disclosure requirements. 


        Within sectors, risk management may depend on existing guidelines for specific applications and use case settings. Where established guidelines do not exist, organizations will want to define reasonable risk tolerance in consideration of different sources of risk (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, and model risks) and different levels of risk (e.g., from negligible to critical).


        Risk tolerances inform and support decisions about whether to continue with development or deployment - termed “go/no-go”. Go/no-go decisions related to AI system risks can take stakeholder feedback into account, but remain independent from stakeholders’ vested financial or reputational interests.


        If mapping risk is prohibitively difficult, a "no-go" decision may be considered for the specific system.
    - point: System requirements (e.g., “the system shall respect the privacy of its
        users”) are elicited from and understood by relevant AI actors.  Design
        decisions take socio-technical implications into account to address AI
        risks.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        AI system development requirements may outpace documentation
        processes for traditional software. When written requirements are
        unavailable or incomplete, AI actors may inadvertently overlook business
        and stakeholder needs, over-rely on implicit human biases such as
        confirmation bias and groupthink, and maintain exclusive focus on
        computational requirements. 


        Eliciting system requirements, designing for end users, and considering societal impacts early in the design phase is a priority that can enhance AI systems’ trustworthiness.
    - point: The specific task, and methods used to implement the task, that the AI
        system will support is defined (e.g., classifiers, generative models,
        recommenders).
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI actors define the technical learning or decision-making task(s)
        an AI system is designed to accomplish, or the benefits that the system
        will provide. The clearer and narrower the task definition, the easier it
        is to map its benefits and risks, leading to more fulsome risk management.
    - point: Information about the AI system’s knowledge limits and how system output
        may be utilized and overseen by humans is documented. Documentation
        provides sufficient information to assist relevant AI actors when making
        informed decisions and taking subsequent actions.

      details: >-
        An AI lifecycle consists of many interdependent activities
        involving a diverse set of actors that often do not have full visibility
        or control over other parts of the lifecycle and its associated contexts
        or risks. The interdependencies between these activities, and among the
        relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably
        anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions
        in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its
        behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as
        end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative
        impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within
        one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with
        decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and
        varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed
        and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest
        unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms. These
        risks and incidents can result from a variety of factors. For example,
        downstream decisions can be influenced by end user over-trust or
        under-trust, and other complexities related to AI-supported
        decision-making.


        Anticipating, articulating, assessing and documenting AI systems’ knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans can help mitigate the uncertainty associated with the realities of AI system deployments. Rigorous design processes include defining system knowledge limits, which are confirmed and refined based on TEVV processes.
    - point: Scientific integrity and TEVV considerations are identified and
        documented, including those related to experimental design, data
        collection and selection (e.g., availability, representativeness,
        suitability), system trustworthiness, and construct validation.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Standard testing and evaluation protocols provide a basis to
        confirm assurance in a system that it is operating as designed and
        claimed. AI systems’ complexities create challenges for traditional
        testing and evaluation methodologies, which tend to be designed for static
        or isolated system performance.  Opportunities for risk continue well
        beyond design and deployment, into system operation and application of
        system-enabled decisions. Testing and evaluation methodologies and metrics
        therefore address a continuum of activities. TEVV is enhanced when key
        metrics for performance, safety, and reliability are interpreted in a
        socio-technical context and not confined to the boundaries of the AI
        system pipeline. 


        Other challenges for managing AI risks relate to dependence on large scale datasets, which can impact data quality and validity concerns. The difficulty of finding the “right” data may lead AI actors to select datasets based more on accessibility and availability than on suitability for operationalizing the phenomenon that the AI system intends to support or inform. Such decisions could contribute to an environment where the data used in processes is not fully representative of the populations or phenomena that are being modeled, introducing downstream risks.  Practices such as dataset reuse may also lead to disconnect from the social contexts and time periods of their creation.  This contributes to issues of validity of the underlying dataset for providing proxies, measures, or predictors within the model.

        benchmarks.


        It is encouraged that risk management and assessment of benefits and impacts include processes for regular and meaningful communication with potentially affected groups and communities. These stakeholders can provide valuable input related to systems’ benefits and possible limitations. Organizations may differ in the types and number of stakeholders with which they engage.


        Other approaches such as human-centered design (HCD) and value-sensitive design (VSD) can help AI teams to engage broadly with individuals and communities. This type of engagement can enable AI teams to learn about how a given technology may cause positive or negative impacts, that were not originally considered or intended.
    - point: Potential costs, including non-monetary costs, which result from expected

      priority: Advanced
      details: Anticipating negative impacts of AI systems is a difficult task.
        Negative impacts can be due to many factors, such as system
        non-functionality or use outside of its operational limits, and may range
        from minor annoyance to serious injury, financial losses, or regulatory
        enforcement actions. AI actors can work with a broad set of stakeholders
        to improve their capacity for understanding  systems’ potential impacts –
        and subsequently – systems’ risks.

        decision-making tasks and the system context. A narrow application scope
        also helps ease TEVV functions and related resources within an
        organization.


        For example, large language models or open-ended chatbot systems that interact with the public on the internet have a large number of risks that may be difficult to map, measure, and manage due to the variability from both the decision-making task and the operational context. Instead, a task-specific chatbot utilizing templated responses that follow a defined “user journey” is a scope that can be more easily mapped, measured and managed.

      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Human-AI configurations can span from fully autonomous to fully
        manual. AI systems can autonomously make decisions, defer decision-making
        to a human expert, or be used by a human decision-maker as an additional
        opinion. In some scenarios, professionals with expertise in a specific
        domain work in conjunction with an AI system towards a specific end
        goal—for example, a decision about another individual(s). Depending on the
        purpose of the system, the expert may interact with the AI system but is
        rarely part of the design or development of the system itself. These
        experts are not necessarily familiar with machine learning, data science,
        computer science, or other fields traditionally associated with AI design
        or development and - depending on the application - will likely not
        require such familiarity. For example, for AI systems that are deployed in
        health care delivery the experts are the physicians and bring their
        expertise about medicine—not data science, data modeling and engineering,
        or other computational factors. The challenge in these settings is not
        educating the end user about AI system capabilities, but rather
        leveraging, and not replacing, practitioner domain expertise.


        Questions remain about how to configure humans and automation for managing AI risks. Risk management is enhanced when organizations that design, develop or deploy AI systems for use by professional operators and practitioners:


        -  are aware of these knowledge limitations and strive to identify risks in human-AI interactions and configurations across all contexts, and the potential resulting impacts, 

        - define and differentiate the various human roles and responsibilities when using or interacting with AI systems, and

        - determine proficiency standards for AI system operation in proposed context of use, as enumerated in MAP-1 and established in GOVERN-3.2.
    - point: Processes for human oversight are defined, assessed, and documented in
        accordance with organizational policies from GOVERN function.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        As AI systems have evolved in accuracy and precision, computational
        systems have moved from being used purely for decision support—or for
        explicit use by and under the

        control of a human operator—to automated decision making with limited input from humans. Computational decision support systems augment another, typically human, system in making decisions.These types of configurations increase the likelihood of outputs being produced with little human involvement. 


        Defining and differentiating various human roles and responsibilities for AI systems’ governance,  and differentiating AI system overseers and those using or interacting with AI systems can enhance AI risk management activities. 


        In critical systems, high-stakes settings, and systems deemed high-risk it is of vital importance to evaluate risks and effectiveness of oversight procedures before an AI system is deployed.


        Ultimately, AI system oversight is a shared responsibility, and attempts to properly authorize or govern oversight practices will not be effective without organizational buy-in and accountability mechanisms, for example those suggested in the GOVERN function.

        risks may be difficult to map since risk priorities or tolerances may not
        be the same as the deployer organization.


        For example, the use of pre-trained models, which tend to rely on large uncurated dataset or often have undisclosed origins, has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and unanticipated effects along with possible introduction of increased levels of statistical uncertainty, difficulty with reproducibility, and issues with scientific validity.

        internal risk controls for these technology sources and build up practices
        for evaluating third-party material prior to deployment.

        If an organization decides to proceed with deploying the system, the
        likelihood and magnitude estimates can be used to assign TEVV resources
        appropriate for the risk level.

        communities, organizations, and society, as well as the environment and
        national security.


        Organizations can create a baseline for system monitoring to increase opportunities for detecting emergent risks. After an AI system is deployed, engaging different stakeholder groups – who may be aware of, or experience, benefits or negative impacts that are unknown to AI actors involved in the design, development and deployment activities – allows organizations to understand and monitor system benefits and potential negative impacts more readily.
    - point: Approaches and metrics for measurement of AI risks enumerated during the
        Map function are selected for implementation starting with the most

      details: >-
        The development and utility of trustworthy AI systems depends on
        reliable measurements and evaluations of underlying technologies and their
        use. Compared with traditional software systems, AI technologies bring new
        failure modes, inherent dependence on training data and methods which
        directly tie to data quality and representativeness. Additionally, AI
        systems are inherently socio-technical in nature, meaning they are
        influenced by societal dynamics and human behavior. AI risks – and
        benefits – can emerge from the interplay of technical aspects combined
        with societal factors related to how a system is used, its interactions
        with other AI systems, who operates it, and the social context in which it
        is deployed. In other words, What should be measured depends on the
        purpose, audience, and needs of the evaluations. 
        
        These two factors influence selection of approaches and metrics for measurement of AI risks enumerated during the Map function. The AI landscape is evolving and so are the methods and metrics for AI measurement. The evolution of metrics is key to maintaining efficacy of the measures.

        settings, data drift, model drift are among factors that suggest regularly
        assessing and updating appropriateness of AI metrics and their
        effectiveness can enhance reliability of AI system measurements.
    - point: Internal experts who did not serve as front-line developers for the
        system and/or independent assessors are involved in regular assessments
        and updates. Domain experts, users, AI actors external to the team that

        reliance on local evaluations will be necessary along with a continuous
        monitoring of these systems. Measurements that extend beyond classical
        measures (which average across test cases) or expand to focus on pockets
        of failures where there are potentially significant costs can improve the
        reliability of risk management activities. Feedback from affected
        communities about how AI systems are being used can make AI evaluation
        purposeful. Involving internal experts who did not serve as front-line

        with human subjects or using data captured from human subjects. Protection
        of human subjects is required by law when carrying out federally funded
        research, and is a domain specific requirement for some disciplines.
        Standard human subjects protection procedures include protecting the
        welfare and interests of human subjects, designing  evaluations to
        minimize risks to subjects, and completion of mandatory training regarding
        legal requirements and expectations. 
        
        Evaluations of AI system performance that utilize human subjects or human subject data should reflect the population within the context of use. AI system activities utilizing non-representative data may lead to inaccurate assessments or negative and harmful outcomes. It is often difficult – and sometimes impossible, to collect data or perform evaluation tasks that reflect the full operational purview of an AI system. Methods for collecting, annotating, or using these data can also contribute to the challenge. To counteract these challenges, organizations can connect human subjects data collection, and dataset practices, to AI system contexts and purposes and do so in close collaboration with AI Actors from the relevant domains.
    - point: AI system performance or assurance criteria are measured qualitatively or
        quantitatively and demonstrated for conditions similar to deployment
        setting(s). Measures are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: The current risk and impact environment suggests AI system
        performance estimates are insufficient and require a deeper understanding
        of deployment context of use. Computationally focused performance testing
        and evaluation schemes are restricted to test data sets and in silico
        techniques. These approaches do not directly evaluate risks and impacts in
        real world environments and can only predict what might create impact
        based on an approximation of expected AI use. To properly manage risks,
        more direct information is necessary to understand how and under what
        conditions deployed AI creates impacts, who is most likely to be impacted,
        and what that experience is like.
    - point: The functionality and behavior of the AI system and its components – as
        identified in the MAP function – are monitored when in production.
      priority: Advanced
      details: AI systems may encounter new issues and risks while in production
        as the environment evolves over time. This effect, often referred to as
        “drift”, means AI systems no longer meet the assumptions and limitations
        of the original design. Regular monitoring allows AI Actors to monitor the
        functionality and behavior of the AI system and its components – as
        identified in the MAP function - and enhance the speed and efficacy of
        necessary system interventions.
    - point: The AI system to be deployed is demonstrated to be valid and reliable.
        Limitations of the generalizability beyond the conditions under which the
        technology was developed are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        An AI system that is not validated or that fails validation may be
        inaccurate or unreliable or may generalize poorly to data and settings
        beyond its training, creating and increasing AI risks and reducing
        trustworthiness. AI Actors can improve system validity by creating
        processes for exploring and documenting system limitations. This includes
        broad consideration of purposes and uses for which the system was not
        designed. 


        Validation risks include the use of proxies or other indicators that are often constructed by AI development teams to operationalize phenomena that are either not directly observable or measurable (e.g, fairness, hireability, honesty, propensity to commit a crime). Teams can mitigate these risks by demonstrating that the indicator is measuring the concept it claims to measure (also known as construct validity). Without this and other types of validation, various negative properties or impacts may go undetected, including the presence of confounding variables, potential spurious correlations, or error propagation and its potential impact on other interconnected systems.
    - point: AI system is evaluated regularly for safety risks – as identified in the
        MAP function. The AI system to be deployed is demonstrated to be safe, its
        residual negative risk does not exceed the risk tolerance, and can fail
        safely, particularly if made to operate beyond its knowledge limits.
        Safety metrics implicate system reliability and robustness, real-time
        monitoring, and response times for AI system failures.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Many AI systems are being introduced into settings such as
        transportation, manufacturing or security, where failures may give rise to
        various physical or environmental harms. AI systems that may endanger
        human life, health, property or the environment are tested thoroughly
        prior to  deployment, and are regularly evaluated to confirm the system is
        safe during normal operations, and in settings beyond its proposed use and
        knowledge limits. 


        Measuring activities for safety often relate to exhaustive testing in development and deployment contexts, understanding the limits of a system’s reliable, robust, and safe behavior, and real-time monitoring of various aspects of system performance. These activities are typically conducted along with other risk mapping, management, and governance tasks such as avoiding past failed designs, establishing and rehearsing incident response plans that enable quick responses to system problems, the instantiation of redundant functionality to cover failures, and transparent and accountable governance. System safety incidents or failures are frequently reported to be related to organizational dynamics and culture. Independent auditors may bring important independent perspectives for reviewing evidence of AI system safety.
    - point: AI system security and resilience – as identified in the MAP function –
        are evaluated and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        AI systems, as well as the ecosystems in which they are deployed,
        may be said to be resilient if they can withstand unexpected adverse
        events or unexpected changes in their environment or use – or if they can
        maintain their functions and structure in the face of internal

        and external change and degrade safely and gracefully when this is necessary. Common security concerns relate to adversarial examples, data poisoning, and the exfiltration of models, training data, or other intellectual property through AI system endpoints. AI systems that can maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability through protection mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access and use may be said to be secure. 


        Security and resilience are related but distinct characteristics. While resilience is the ability

        to return to normal function after an unexpected adverse event, security includes resilience

        but also encompasses protocols to avoid, protect against, respond to, or recover

        from attacks. Resilience relates to robustness and encompasses unexpected or adversarial use (or abuse or misuse) of the model or data.
    - point: Risks associated with transparency and accountability – as identified in
        the MAP function – are examined and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Transparency enables meaningful visibility into entire AI
        pipelines, workflows, processes or organizations and decreases information
        asymmetry between AI developers and operators and other AI Actors and
        impacted communities. Transparency is a central element of effective AI
        risk management that enables insight into how an AI system is working, and
        the ability to address risks if and when they emerge. The ability for
        system users, individuals, or impacted communities to seek redress for
        incorrect or problematic AI system outcomes is one control for
        transparency and accountability. Higher level recourse processes are
        typically enabled by lower level implementation efforts directed at
        explainability and interpretability functionality. See Measure 2.9.


        Transparency and accountability across organizations and processes is crucial to reducing AI risks. Accountable leadership – whether individuals or groups – and transparent roles, responsibilities, and lines of communication foster and incentivize quality assurance and risk management activities within organizations.


        Lack of transparency complicates measurement of trustworthiness and whether AI systems or organizations are subject to effects of various individual and group biases and design blindspots and could lead to diminished user, organizational and community trust, and decreased overall system value. Enstating accountable and transparent organizational structures along with documenting system risks can enable system improvement and risk management efforts, allowing AI actors along the lifecycle to identify errors, suggest improvements, and figure out new ways to contextualize and generalize AI system features and outcomes.
    - point: The AI model is explained, validated, and documented, and  AI system
        output is interpreted within its context – as identified in the MAP
        function – and to inform responsible use and governance.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Explainability and interpretability assist those operating or
        overseeing an AI system, as well as users of an AI system, to gain deeper
        insights into the functionality and trustworthiness of the system,
        including its outputs.


        Explainable and interpretable AI systems offer information that help end users understand the purposes and potential impact of an AI system. Risk from lack of explainability may be managed by describing how AI systems function, with descriptions tailored to individual differences such as the user’s role, knowledge, and skill level. Explainable systems can be debugged and monitored more easily, and they lend themselves to more thorough documentation, audit, and governance.


        Risks to interpretability often can be addressed by communicating a description of why

        an AI system made a particular prediction or recommendation. 


        Transparency, explainability, and interpretability are distinct characteristics that support

        each other. Transparency can answer the question of “what happened”. Explainability can answer the question of “how” a decision was made in the system. Interpretability can answer the question of “why” a decision was made by the system and its

        meaning or context to the user.
    - point: Privacy risk of the AI system – as identified in the MAP function – is
        examined and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Privacy refers generally to the norms and practices that help to
        safeguard human autonomy, identity, and dignity. These norms and practices
        typically address freedom from intrusion, limiting observation, or
        individuals’ agency to consent to disclosure or control of facets of

        their identities (e.g., body, data, reputation). 


        Privacy values such as anonymity, confidentiality, and control generally should guide choices for AI system design, development, and deployment. Privacy-related risks may influence security, bias, and transparency and come with tradeoffs with these other characteristics. Like safety and security, specific technical features of an AI system may promote or reduce privacy. AI systems can also present new risks to privacy by allowing inference to identify individuals or previously private information about individuals.


        Privacy-enhancing technologies (“PETs”) for AI, as well as data minimizing methods such as de-identification and aggregation for certain model outputs, can support design for privacy-enhanced AI systems. Under certain conditions such as data sparsity, privacy enhancing techniques can result in a loss in accuracy, impacting decisions about fairness and other values in certain domains.
    - point: Fairness and bias – as identified in the MAP function – is evaluated and
        results are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Fairness in AI includes concerns for equality and equity by
        addressing issues such as harmful bias and discrimination. Standards of
        fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of
        fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application.
        Organizations’ risk management efforts will be enhanced by recognizing and
        considering these differences. Systems in which harmful biases are
        mitigated are not necessarily fair. For example, systems in which
        predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be
        inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital
        divide or may exacerbate existing disparities or systemic biases.


        Bias is broader than demographic balance and data representativeness. NIST has identified three major categories of AI bias to be considered and managed: systemic, computational and statistical, and human-cognitive. Each of these can occur in the absence of prejudice, partiality, or discriminatory intent. 


        - Systemic bias can be present in AI datasets, the organizational norms, practices, and processes across the AI lifecycle, and the broader society that uses AI systems.

        - Computational and statistical biases can be present in AI datasets and algorithmic processes, and often stem from systematic errors due to non-representative samples.

        - Human-cognitive biases relate to how an individual or group perceives AI system information to make a decision or fill in missing information, or how humans think about purposes and functions of an AI system. Human-cognitive biases are omnipresent in decision-making processes across the AI lifecycle and system use, including the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of AI.


        Bias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives. While bias is not always a negative phenomenon, AI systems can potentially increase the speed and scale of biases and perpetuate and amplify harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society.
    - point: Environmental impact and sustainability of AI model training and
        management activities – as identified in the MAP function – are assessed
        and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Large-scale, high-performance computational resources used by AI
        systems for training and operation can contribute to environmental
        impacts.  Direct negative impacts to the environment from these processes
        are related to energy consumption, water consumption, and greenhouse gas
        (GHG) emissions. The OECD has identified metrics for each type of negative
        direct impact. 


        Indirect negative impacts to the environment reflect the complexity of interactions between human behavior, socio-economic systems, and the environment and can include induced consumption and “rebound effects”, where efficiency gains are offset by accelerated resource consumption. 


        Other AI related environmental impacts can arise from the production of computational equipment and networks (e.g. mining and extraction of raw materials), transporting hardware, and electronic waste recycling or disposal.
    - point: Effectiveness of the employed TEVV metrics and processes in the MEASURE
        function are evaluated and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The development of metrics is a process often considered to be
        objective but, as a human and organization driven endeavor, can reflect
        implicit and systemic biases, and may inadvertently reflect factors
        unrelated to the target function. Measurement approaches can be
        oversimplified, gamed, lack critical nuance, become used and relied upon
        in unexpected ways, fail to account for differences in affected groups and
        contexts.


        Revisiting the metrics chosen in Measure 2.1 through 2.12 in a process of continual improvement can help AI actors to evaluate and document metric effectiveness and make necessary course corrections.
    - point: Approaches, personnel, and documentation are in place to regularly
        identify and track existing, unanticipated, and emergent AI risks based on
        factors such as intended and actual performance in deployed contexts.
      priority: Advanced
      details: For trustworthy AI systems, regular system monitoring is carried
        out in accordance with organizational governance policies, AI actor roles
        and responsibilities, and within a culture of continual improvement. If
        and when emergent or complex risks arise, it may be necessary to adapt
        internal risk management procedures, such as regular monitoring, to stay
        on course. Documentation, resources, and training are part of an overall
        strategy to support AI actors as they investigate and respond to AI system
        errors, incidents or negative impacts.
    - point: Risk tracking approaches are considered for settings where AI risks are
        difficult to assess using currently available measurement techniques or
        where metrics are not yet available.
      priority: Advanced
      details: Risks identified in the Map function may be complex, emerge over
        time, or difficult to measure. Systematic methods for risk tracking,
        including novel measurement approaches, can be established as part of
        regular monitoring and improvement processes.
    - point: Feedback processes for end users and impacted communities to report
        problems and appeal system outcomes are established and integrated into AI
        system evaluation metrics.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Assessing impact is a two-way effort. Many AI system outcomes and
        impacts may not be visible or recognizable to AI actors across the
        development and deployment dimensions of the AI lifecycle, and may require
        direct feedback about system outcomes from the perspective of end users
        and impacted groups.


        Feedback can be collected indirectly, via systems that are mechanized to collect errors and other feedback from end users and operators


        Metrics and insights developed in this sub-category feed into Manage 4.1 and 4.2.
    - point: Measurement approaches for identifying AI risks are connected to
        deployment context(s) and informed through consultation with domain
        experts and other end users. Approaches are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        AI Actors carrying out TEVV tasks may have difficulty evaluating
        impacts within the system context of use. AI system risks and impacts are
        often best described by end users and others who may be affected by output
        and subsequent decisions. AI Actors can elicit feedback from impacted
        individuals and communities via participatory engagement processes
        established in Govern 5.1 and 5.2, and carried out in Map 1.6, 5.1, and
        5.2. 


        Activities described in the Measure function enable AI actors to evaluate feedback from impacted individuals and communities. To increase awareness of insights, feedback can be evaluated in close collaboration with AI actors responsible for impact assessment, human-factors, and governance and oversight tasks, as well as with other socio-technical domain experts and researchers. To gain broader expertise for interpreting evaluation outcomes, organizations may consider collaborating with advocacy groups and civil society organizations. 


        Insights based on this type of analysis can inform TEVV-based decisions about metrics and related courses of action.
    - point: Measurement results regarding AI system trustworthiness in deployment
        context(s) and across AI lifecycle are informed by input from domain
        experts and other relevant AI actors to validate whether the system is
        performing consistently as intended. Results are documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Feedback captured from relevant AI Actors can be evaluated in
        combination with output from Measure 2.5 to 2.11 to determine if the AI
        system is performing within pre-defined operational limits for validity
        and reliability, safety, security and resilience, privacy, bias and
        fairness, explainability and interpretability, and transparency and
        accountability. This feedback provides an additional layer of insight
        about AI system performance, including potential misuse or reuse outside
        of intended settings. 



        Insights based on this type of analysis can inform TEVV-based decisions about metrics and related courses of action.
    - point: Measurable performance improvements or declines based on consultations
        with relevant AI actors including affected communities, and field data
        about context-relevant risks and trustworthiness characteristics, are
        identified and documented.
      priority: Advanced
      details: TEVV activities conducted throughout the AI system lifecycle can
        provide baseline quantitative measures for trustworthy characteristics.
        When combined with results from Measure 2.5 to 2.11 and Measure 4.1 and
        4.2, TEVV actors can maintain a comprehensive view of system performance.
        These measures can be augmented through participatory engagement with
        potentially impacted communities or other forms of stakeholder elicitation
        about AI systems’ impacts. These sources of information can allow AI
        actors to explore potential adjustments to system components, adapt
        operating conditions, or institute performance improvements.

        Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image
        annotation tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom
        endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob
        Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an
        attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs
        whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By
        doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT
        backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server
        on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or
        Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows
        authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the
        attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They
        may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the
        server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud
        storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable
        annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on
        this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact
        capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is
        configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In
        this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to
        requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses
        prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use
        network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to
        prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your
        internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal
        servers.

        CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been
        identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200)
        permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can
        exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security
        parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to
        excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server
        overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an
        openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed by
        the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an
        attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU
        resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the
        availability of services running on the affected server, posing a
        significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly
        forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an
        attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue.

        OAuthenticator is software that allows OAuth2 identity providers to be
        plugged in and used with JupyterHub. JupyterHub < 5.0, when used with
        `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a
        particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0,
        because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`.
        Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over
        `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be
        allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider`
        will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0,
        but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes
        the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a
        workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using
        `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration.

        NuGet Gallery is a package repository that powers nuget.org. The
        NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of
        autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out
        JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks.
        This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for

        such as `<javascript:alert(1)>`, the link is rendered without proper

        be executed by the browser, leading to an XSS attack. Version 2024.05.28

However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset.

        Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes
        alongside their notebook server and provide authenticated web access to
        them. Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a
        reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts
        a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is
        called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a
        response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A
        third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an
        invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user
        clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET
        /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set
        by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks
        on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's
        JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0
        and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can
        disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.

        The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy
        resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS
        Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region
        deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS
        Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline,
        AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and
        management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap
        process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate
        multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies
        on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap
        process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an
        event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions
        to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function,
        they would be able to escalate their privileges.


        Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to
        the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it
        is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the
        elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default,
        this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations,
        providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS
        Account. The patches for this issue are included in
        `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.


        As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created
        by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all
        IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until
        you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary
        is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are
        unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the
        privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create,
        manage, and bootstrap accounts.

        OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other
        Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting
        the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic
        link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the
        provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given
        that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of
        permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the
        aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability
        is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that
        specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the
        Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf
        configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in
        cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a
        `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root)
        command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu
        systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit
        ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.

        Version 2.0.0 introduces changes to mitigate this issue. Version 2.0.0

        also escaped to prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:


        af_unix: Update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under sk_receive_queue lock.


        Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong reported a race between __unix_gc() and

        queue_oob().


        __unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect close()d inflight sockets,

        and then if the socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, GC

        will drop the reference and set NULL to it locklessly.


        However, the peer socket still can send MSG_OOB message and

        queue_oob() can update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb concurrently, leading

        NULL pointer dereference. [0]


        To fix the issue, let's update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under the

        sk_receive_queue's lock and take it everywhere we touch oob_skb.


        Note that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob() to silence lockdep

        false-positive (See [1]).

        liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations

        encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`,

        options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information,
        however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race

        __dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when
        sk->dst_cache must be cleared, leading to possible UAF.

        RCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache,
        then call dst_release(old_dst).

        Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly,
        while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.

        Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic
        against RTF_CACHE, this means each of the three ->negative_advice()
        existing methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.

        Note the check against NULL dst is centralized in
        __dst_negative_advice(), there is no need to duplicate
        it in various callbacks.

        Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.

        The Kyber reference implementation before 9b8d306, when compiled by LLVM

        In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access
        control vulnerability allows users to create, update, get, and delete
        prompt variations for datasets not owned by their organization. This issue
        arises due to the application not properly validating the ownership of
        dataset prompts and their variations against the organization or project
        of the requesting user. As a result, unauthorized modifications to dataset
        prompts can occur, leading to altered or removed dataset prompts without
        proper authorization. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and
        consistency of dataset information, potentially affecting the results of
        experiments.

        An issue was discovered on Mitel 6869i through 4.5.0.41 and 5.x through

        A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse
        old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session
        expiration. Specifically, the session does not expire after a password
        change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account
        without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was
        observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after
        changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and
        usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.

        In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.2.13, an improper authorization
        vulnerability exists that allows unauthorized users to access and
        manipulate projects within an organization they should not have access to.
        Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess`
        method within the authorization middleware, which fails to adequately
        verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project.
        Instead, it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the
        project, overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project`
        table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to
        gain complete control over all resources within a project, including the
        ability to create, update, read, and delete any resource, compromising the
        privacy and security of sensitive information.

        This appears to work around a deadlock regression that came in
        with the LED merge in 6.9.

        The deadlock happens on my system with 24 iwlwifi radios, so maybe
        it something like all worker threads are busy and some work that needs
        to complete cannot complete.

        drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config


        When slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation

        of the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This

        leaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a

        check to avoid the division by zero.


        The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on

        a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor

        connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception

        when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.

        After applying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitor

        is connected and the system is rebooted. I believe this is the same

        issue reported for 3113.

        Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix div-by-zero in l2cap_le_flowctl_init()


        l2cap_le_flowctl_init() can cause both div-by-zero and an integer

        overflow since hdev->le_mtu may not fall in the valid range.


        Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connection

        process earlier if MTU is invalid.

        Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it return

        an error value if the validation fails.

        Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a

        kzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.

        remoteproc: mediatek: Make sure IPI buffer fits in L2TCM

        The IPI buffer location is read from the firmware that we load to the
        System Companion Processor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM
        (L2TCM) size that is defined in the devicetree node is large enough
        for that, and while this is especially true for multi-core SCP, it's
        still useful to check on single-core variants as well.

        Failing to perform this check may make this driver perform R/W
        operations out of the L2TCM boundary, resulting (at best) in a
        kernel panic.

        To fix that, check that the IPI buffer fits, otherwise return a
        failure and refuse to boot the relevant SCP core (or the SCP at
        all, if this is single core).

        A vulnerability in the PyTorch's torch.distributed.rpc framework,
        specifically in versions prior to 2.2.2, allows for remote code execution
        (RCE). The framework, which is used in distributed training scenarios,
        does not properly verify the functions being called during RPC (Remote
        Procedure Call) operations. This oversight permits attackers to execute
        arbitrary commands by leveraging built-in Python functions such as eval
        during multi-cpu RPC communication. The vulnerability arises from the lack
        of restriction on function calls when a worker node serializes and sends a
        PythonUDF (User Defined Function) to the master node, which then
        deserializes and executes the function without validation. This flaw can
        be exploited to compromise master nodes initiating distributed training,

        parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to path traversal and denial of
        service attacks due to an exposed `/select_database` endpoint in version
        a9d16b0. The endpoint improperly handles file paths, allowing attackers to
        specify absolute paths when interacting with the `DiscussionsDB` instance.
        This flaw enables attackers to create directories anywhere on the system
        where the application has permissions, potentially leading to denial of
        service by creating directories with names of critical files, such as
        HTTPS certificate files, causing server startup failures. Additionally,
        attackers can manipulate the database path, resulting in the loss of
        client data by constantly changing the file location to an
        attacker-controlled location, scattering the data across the filesystem
        and making recovery difficult.

        results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string
        before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this
        vulnerability to execute code in the context of a10user. Was

        A TarSlip vulnerability exists in the deepjavalibrary/djl, affecting
        version 0.26.0 and fixed in version 0.27.0. This vulnerability allows an
        attacker to manipulate file paths within tar archives to overwrite
        arbitrary files on the target system. Exploitation of this vulnerability
        could lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation, data theft or
        manipulation, and denial of service. The vulnerability is due to improper
        validation of file paths during the extraction of tar files, as
        demonstrated in multiple occurrences within the library's codebase,
        including but not limited to the files_util.py and extract_imagenet.py
        scripts.

        A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
        significant-gravitas/autogpt version v0.5.0 allows attackers to execute
        arbitrary commands on the AutoGPT server. The vulnerability stems from the
        lack of protections on the API endpoint receiving instructions, enabling
        an attacker to direct a user running AutoGPT in their local network to a
        malicious website. This site can then send crafted requests to the AutoGPT
        server, leading to command execution. The issue is exacerbated by CORS
        being enabled for arbitrary origins by default, allowing the attacker to
        read the response of all cross-site queries. This vulnerability was
        addressed in version 5.1.

        Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. A theoretical
        request smuggling vulnerability exists through Envoy if a server can be
        tricked into adding an upgrade header into a response. Per RFC
        https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-6.7 a server sends 101 when
        switching protocols. Envoy incorrectly accepts a 200 response from a
        server when requesting a protocol upgrade, but 200 does not indicate
        protocol switch. This opens up the possibility of request smuggling
        through Envoy if the server can be tricked into adding the upgrade header
        to the response.

        This vulnerability allows any user on the server to access the chat
        history of any other user without requiring any form of interaction
        between the users. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to data
        breaches, including the exposure of sensitive personal details, financial

        nano-id is a unique string ID generator for Rust. Affected versions of the
        nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in
        the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the
        `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the
        intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16
        symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the
        `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is
        not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that
        `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result
        in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs
        predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in
        security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.

        Prior to this, commit 4cd12c6065df ("bpf, sockmap: Fix NULL pointer

        dereference in sk_psock_verdict_data_ready()") fixed one NULL pointer

        similarly due to no protection of saved_data_ready. Here is another

        different caller causing the same issue because of the same reason. So

        we should protect it with sk_callback_lock read lock because the writer

        side in the sk_psock_drop() uses "write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);".


        To avoid errors that could happen in future, I move those two pairs of

        lock into the sk_psock_data_ready(), which is suggested by John Fastabend.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal

        Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can
        run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free
        the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
        checked against NULL.

        If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
        that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

        Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around
        the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the
        same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

        spi: fix null pointer dereference within spi_sync

        If spi_sync() is called with the non-empty queue and the same spi_message

        the context is cleared, leading to a null pointer dereference when the

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        powerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE

        At the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware
        property ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI
        bus the PE is attached to.

        There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this
        property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is
        where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This
        PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.

        Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be
        presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.

        Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointer
        dereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        maple_tree: fix mas_empty_area_rev() null pointer dereference

        Currently the code calls mas_start() followed by mas_data_end() if the
        maple state is MA_START, but mas_start() may return with the maple state
        node == NULL.  This will lead to a null pointer dereference when checking
        information in the NULL node, which is done in mas_data_end().

        Avoid setting the offset if there is no node by waiting until after the
        maple state is checked for an empty or single entry state.

        A user could trigger the events to cause a kernel oops by unmapping all
        vmas to produce an empty maple tree, then mapping a vma that would cause
        the scenario described above.

        tty: n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()


        Assuming the following:

        - side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode

        - side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data length 1

        - side A switches to advanced option mode

        - side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->len
          Reason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode.
        - side A switches to basic option mode

        - side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm->buf
          Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset after
          reconfiguration.

        Fix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparison from equal to less

        than. Also add upper limit checks against the constant MAX_MRU in

        gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memory corruption of

        gsm->len and gsm->mru.


        All other checks remain as we still need to limit the data according to
        the

        user configuration and actual payload size.

        net: nexthop: fix null pointer dereference when IPv6 is not enabled

        When we try to add an IPv6 nexthop and IPv6 is not enabled
        (!CONFIG_IPV6) we'll hit a NULL pointer dereference[1] in the error path
        of nh_create_ipv6() due to calling ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release. The bug
        has been present since the beginning of IPv6 nexthop gateway support.
        Commit 1aefd3de7bc6 ("ipv6: Add fib6_nh_init and release to stubs") tells
        us that only fib6_nh_init has a dummy stub because fib6_nh_release should
        not be called if fib6_nh_init returns an error, but the commit below added
        a call to ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in its error path. To fix it return
        the dummy stub's -EAFNOSUPPORT error directly without calling
        ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in nh_create_ipv6()'s error path.

        ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

        ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and
        .set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is
        buggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver
        provides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer
        dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.

        Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
        ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

        Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
        legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
        - have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
        .set_coalesce(), or
        - have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't
          cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()
          and bails out on error.

        ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress


        The kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables

        firewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing

        rules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, every

        incoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.


        After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked

        down the issue to ca7a03c41753 ("ipv6: do not free rt if

        FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule").


        The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have

        `FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag

        `RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not

        decreasing the refcount when needed.


        How to reproduce:
        - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:
            meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
          This can be done with:
            sudo nft create table inet test
            sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'
            sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
        - Run:
            sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0
        - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase
          with every incoming ipv6 packet.

        This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol

        specific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`

        argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic

        FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.

        After calling netif_receive_skb(skb), dereferencing skb is unsafe.
        Especially, the can_frame cf which aliases skb memory is dereferenced
        just after the call netif_receive_skb(skb).

        Reordering the lines solves the issue.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        can: m_can: m_can_read_fifo: fix memory leak in error branch

        In m_can_read_fifo(), if the second call to m_can_fifo_read() fails,
        the function jump to the out_fail label and returns without calling
        m_can_receive_skb(). This means that the skb previously allocated by
        alloc_can_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory leak.

        This patch adds a goto label to destroy the skb if an error occurs.

        Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
        Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
        returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
        Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
        the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
        patch is not a complete fix.

        net: ks8851: Handle softirqs at the end of IRQ thread to fix hang

        The ks8851_irq() thread may call ks8851_rx_pkts() in case there are
        any packets in the MAC FIFO, which calls netif_rx(). This netif_rx()
        implementation is guarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable().
        The local_bh_enable() may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case
        any are pending. One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately
        reaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system
        hangs. The entire call chain is below:

        ks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit
        netdev_start_xmit from dev_hard_start_xmit
        dev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmit
        sch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit
        __dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update
        __neigh_update from neigh_update
        neigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0
        arp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core
        __netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog
        process_backlog from __napi_poll.constprop.0
        __napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_action
        net_rx_action from __do_softirq
        __do_softirq from call_with_stack
        call_with_stack from do_softirq
        do_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip
        __local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx
        netif_rx from ks8851_irq
        ks8851_irq from irq_thread_fn
        irq_thread_fn from irq_thread
        irq_thread from kthread
        kthread from ret_from_fork

        The hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks a spinlock in
        ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock, ...)
        and with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the execution
        reaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again
        which attempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the
        hang happens.

        Move the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section
        of ks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected
        section of ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of
        the spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()
        without the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and
        safely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the
        already locked spinlock.

        Since ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable()
        now, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the

        panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

        If some the pages or sgt allocation failed, we shouldn't release the
        pages ref we got earlier, otherwise we will end up with unbalanced
        get/put_pages() calls. We should instead leave everything in place
        and let the BO release function deal with extra cleanup when the object
        is destroyed, or let the fault handler try again next time it's called.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        btrfs: make sure that WRITTEN is set on all metadata blocks

        We previously would call btrfs_check_leaf() if we had the check
        integrity code enabled, which meant that we could only run the extended
        leaf checks if we had WRITTEN set on the header flags.

        This leaves a gap in our checking, because we could end up with
        corruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, and then the
        extended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validate all of
        the item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of the
        extent buffer.

        However, since 732fab95abe2 ("btrfs: check-integrity: remove
        CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option") we no longer call
        btrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we only
        ever call it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTEN
        set, or that are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set.

        Add checks to make sure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then make
        sure __btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking.  This will
        protect us from file systems that have been corrupted and no longer have
        WRITTEN set on some of the blocks.

        This was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTEN bit and reported by
        KASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. The example is a dir
        item at the end of an eb.

        When a file only needs one direct_node, performing the following

        unisoc # ./f2fs_io compress test.apk
        unisoc #df -h | grep dm-48

        unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk

        This is because the file has only one direct_node. After returning
        to -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += ret will not be executed. As a result,
        the reserved_blocks at this time is still 0, which is not the real
        number of reserved blocks. Therefore, fsck cannot be set to repair
        the file.

        After this patch, the fsck flag will be set to fix this problem.

        unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48

        Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be
        very

        slow.


        Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()

        or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may

        experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked

        have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of

        Service.


        The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform

        various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long
        time

        if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.


        Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow
        using

        public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for
        signature

        verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit

        the modulus size when performing the checks.


        An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or
        EVP_PKEY_public_check()

        and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could
        be

        vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.


        These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so

        only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.


        Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line
        applications

        when using the `-check` option.


        The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.


        The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

        Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoid
        working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git
        clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to
        make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but
        vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of
        cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has
        been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the
        fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a
        `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be
        trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run
        within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in
        versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a

        repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create
        hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the
        target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository
        over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files
        on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/`
        directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without
        explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the
        optimizations for local cloning

        will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files
        instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic
        links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for
        CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link
        operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem
        appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the
        operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create

        Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
        Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set
        their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it,
        else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls
        `compat_password_verify`. In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify`
        is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify` and
        `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The
        vulnerability is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is
        compared with correct password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a
        loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version
        1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.

        `raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js to
        fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others). However, it still generates the code
        out of unescaped PHP variables `$title` and `$header`. If those variables
        contain single quotes, they can be used to inject JavaScript code. An
        attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of
        other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized

        Bluetooth: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by sco_sock_timeout


        When the sco connection is established and then, the sco socket

        is releasing, timeout_work will be scheduled to judge whether

        the sco disconnection is timeout. The sock will be deallocated

        later, but it is dereferenced again in sco_sock_timeout. As a

        result, the use-after-free bugs will happen. The root cause is

        shown below:

        xen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle


        Notice that skb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than fixes tag in

        commit 6a5bcd84e886 ("page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling").


        It is believed that fixes tag were missing a call to
        page_pool_release_page()

        between v5.9 to v5.14, after which is should have used
        skb_mark_for_recycle().

        Since v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page() were removed (in

        commit 535b9c61bdef ("net: page_pool: hide page_pool_release_page()")

        and remaining callers converted (in commit 6bfef2ec0172 ("Merge branch

        'net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page'")).


        This leak became visible in v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 ("mm/page_pool:

        Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
        Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability,
        exploitable through the "Package Import" feature, allows authenticated
        users having the "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP
        code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the
        `import_package()` function defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The
        function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the
        XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside,
        since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to
        write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution
        of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a
        patch for this issue.

        A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in
        libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method,
        the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure
        ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data
        pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from
        virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger
        requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this
        issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access.
        This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without
        authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could
        access it.

        On Windows a directory returned by tempfile.mkdtemp() would not always
        have permissions set to restrict reading and writing to the temporary
        directory by other users, instead usually inheriting the correct
        permissions from the default location. Alternate configurations or users
        without a profile directory may not have the intended permissions.


        If you’re not using Windows or haven’t changed the temporary directory
        location then you aren’t affected by this vulnerability. On other
        platforms the returned directory is consistently readable and writable
        only by the current user.


        This issue was caused by Python not supporting Unix permissions on
        Windows. The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on
        Windows which is used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory
        has the proper permissions.

        to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control,
        and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to
        the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires
        the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will
        trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.

        Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected
        versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters.
        XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would
        then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application
        accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these
        in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to
        inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only
        addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is
        now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter,
        and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be
        flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as
        user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.

        RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range
        of devices that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.
        Most codebases define assertion macros which compile to a no-op on
        non-debug builds. If assertions are the only line of defense against
        untrusted input, the software may be exposed to attacks that leverage the
        lack of proper input checks. In detail, in the `nimble_scanlist_update()`
        function below, `len` is checked in an assertion and subsequently used in
        a call to `memcpy()`. If an attacker is able to provide a larger `len`
        value while assertions are compiled-out, they can write past the end of
        the fixed-length `e->ad` buffer. If the unchecked input above is

        Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take

        a long time.


        Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()

        to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that

        is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead

        to a Denial of Service.


        When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,

        a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.

        For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this

        computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,

        then this computation would take a long time.


        An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key

        obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of
        Service

        attack.


        The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL

        functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line

        application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used

        with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.


        The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

        In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

        nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER

        The test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and
        harmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.

        First: harmful.
        As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
        test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
        return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
        clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
        incorrect behaviour.

        If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
        processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
        was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
        thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
        the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
        incorrect error.

        The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
        never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
        it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
        fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
        some later locking request.

        When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
        failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
        which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
        so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.

        So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
        so_count allows.

        The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.

        so_count is the sum of three different counts.
        1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
        2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
        3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.

        When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
        transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
        clear what the other one is expected to be.

        In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
        on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.

        In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
        In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
        all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
        (it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
        when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
        that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.

        The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
        in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
        owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
        test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.

        So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
        find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
        nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
        this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather
        than testing so_count against the mysterious '2'.

        libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous
        I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its
        windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256
        characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to
        create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by
        `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve
        to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability
        arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256
        bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in
        `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets
        truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be
        able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that

        **DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based
        toolchains 

        that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer 

        overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application 

        without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies 

        to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using 

        alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized 

        local variables.


        The default behavior when the stack-protector 

        detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in 

        controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer 

        overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change 

        program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to
        go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very
        slow.


        Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(),
        DH_check_ex()

        or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may
        experience long

        delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
        obtained

        from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.


        The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of
        those

        checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying
        to use

        a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus
        which

        is over 10,000 bits in length.


        However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
        parameters

        that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus
        value

        even if it has already been found to be too large.


        An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
        obtained

        from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service
        attack.


        The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL
        functions.

        An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be
        affected.

        The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and

        EVP_PKEY_param_check().


        Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line
        applications

        when using the '-check' option.


        The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

        The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

        c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial
        of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a
        malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target
        resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a
        graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in
        version 1.19.1.

        c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is
        vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular
        "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause an issue.  C-ares only uses this
        function internally for configuration purposes which would require an
        administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist().
        However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes
        and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in
        1.19.1.

        Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including
        2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured
        SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to
        authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect
        Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY
        config.


        All superset installations should always set a unique secure random
        SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies
        and encrypting sensitive information on the database.

        Add a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:


        SECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>


        Alternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment
        variable.

        Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system.
        Versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3,
        and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure of sensitive information to a malicious
        actor. When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the
        clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's
        `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating
        hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are
        disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim
        to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive
        information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the
        victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them
        clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule
        from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules`
        option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects`
        directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on
        2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid
        cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a
        shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone`
        or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid
        cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or
        run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.

        An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode
        Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters
        via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders
        different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers
        and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for
        compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are
        introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium
        offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An
        issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect
        applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the
        Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display
        behavior when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters,
        the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.
        Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements
        of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens.
        Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that the
        ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will
        be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has
        documented this class of vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical
        Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also
        provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode
        Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode
        Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI
        specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways
        that can mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in
        Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

        From version 1.3.0 onward, Apache Spark's standalone master exposes a REST
        API for job submission, in addition to the submission mechanism used by
        spark-submit. In standalone, the config property
        'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared secret for authenticating
        requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not
        use this or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately
        documented. In this case, a user would be able to run a driver program
        without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the REST API. This
        REST API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e.,
        when also running MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future
        versions of Spark will improve documentation on these points, and prohibit
        setting 'spark.authenticate.secret' when running the REST APIs, to make
        this clear. Future versions will also disable the REST API by default in

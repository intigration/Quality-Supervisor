   Standard guidlines for Project Management Actcities, Reporting and Measurement Tool
  checklist:
    - point: A Project Leader is nominated.

      priority: Essential
      details: Consider using a different email address for security-critical
        communications from trivial mail such as newsletters. This
        compartmentalization could reduce the amount of damage caused by a data
        breach, and also make it easier to recover a compromised account.
    - point: A Project Quality Manager is nominated.
      priority: Essential
      details: Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often
        the starting point for most phishing attacks.
    - point: A Project Architect is nominated
      priority: Essential
      details: Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging
        in. Your email account provides an easy entry point to all your other
        online accounts for an attacker.
    - point: Disable Automatic Loading of Remote Content
      priority: Essential
      details: Email messages can contain remote content such as images or
        stylesheets, often automatically loaded from the server. You should
        disable this, as it exposes your IP address and device information, and
        is often used for tracking. For more info, see [this
        article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20680903/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download).
    - point: Start-up version of Planning Document 
      priority: Optional
      details: "There are two main types of emails on the internet: plaintext and
        HTML. The former is strongly preferred for privacy & security as HTML
        messages often include identifiers in links and inline images, which can
        collect usage and personal data. There's also numerous risks of remote
        code execution targeting the HTML parser of your mail client, which
        cannot be exploited if you are using plaintext. For more info, as well
        as setup instructions for your mail provider, see
        [UsePlaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/)."
    - point: All required QA activities for the next phase are planned and given in the project planning.
      priority: Optional
      details: If you give a third-party app or plug-in full access to your inbox,
        they effectively have full unhindered access to all your emails and
        their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks.
    - point: Requirements for project team members have been specified
      priority: Optional
      details: Emails are very easily intercepted. Furthermore, you can’t be sure of
        how secure your recipient's environment is. Therefore, emails cannot be
        considered safe for exchanging confidential information, unless it is
        encrypted.

  checklist:
    - point: Only Use Fully End-to-End Encrypted Messengers
      priority: Essential
      details: End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where messages are
        encrypted on your device and not decrypted until they reach the intended
        recipient. This ensures that any actor who intercepts traffic cannot
        read the message contents, nor can anybody with access to the central

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and
    give people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and
    share. Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction
    and bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking
    Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations, and
    that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and selling
    that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
    - point: Secure your Account
      priority: Essential
      details: "Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To
        protect your account: use a unique and strong password, and enable
        2-factor authentication."
    - point: Check Privacy Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure
        that you are comfortable with what data you are currently exposing and
        to whom.
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
      priority: Essential
      details: There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content
        across many social networks. Therefore, before uploading, posting or
        commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
      priority: Essential
      details: Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed
        up by a myriad of third-party services, who archive this data and make
        it indexable and publicly available almost forever.
    - point: Don't Reveal too Much
      priority: Essential
      details: Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of
        data that helps them personalize phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much
        detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).
    - point: Be Careful what you Upload
      priority: Essential
      details: Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally
        reveal a lot more than you intended them to. This is especially relevant
        to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.
    - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
      priority: Essential
      details: Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls
        and spammers more munition to use against you, and can also allow
        separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.
    - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
      priority: Essential
      details: By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for
        permission to access your contacts, call log, location, messaging
        history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.
    - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
      priority: Essential
      details: Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke
        access to social apps you no longer use.
    - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
      priority: Essential
      details: If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait
        until you have left that place. This is particularly important when you
        are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
        building or airport.
    - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
      priority: Optional
      details: Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive
        set of additional data (called EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove
        this data before uploading.
    - point: Implement Image Cloaking
      priority: Advanced
      details: Tools like Fawkes can be used to very subtly, slightly change the
        structure of faces within photos in a way that is imperceptible by
        humans, but will prevent facial recognition systems from being able to
        recognize a given face.
    - point: Consider Spoofing GPS in home vicinity
      priority: Advanced
      details: Even if you yourself never use social media, there is always going to
        be others who are not as careful, and could reveal your location.
    - point: Consider False Information
      priority: Advanced
      details: If you just want to read, and do not intend on posting too much-
        consider using an alias name, and false contact details.
    - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
      priority: Advanced
      details: Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online
        security and privacy, avoid using any mainstream social networks.

    Public records often include sensitive personal data (full name, date of birth,
    phone number, email, address, ethnicity etc), and are gathered from a range of
    sources (census records, birth/ death/ marriage certificates, voter registrants,
    marketing information, customer databases, motor vehicle records, professional/
    business licenses and all court files in full detail). This sensitive personal
    information is
    [easy and legal to access](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/its-creepy-but-not-illegal-for-this-website-to-provide-all-your-public-info-to-anyone/),
    which raises some [serious privacy concerns](https://privacyrights.org/resources/public-records-internet-privacy-dilemma)
    (identity theft, personal safety risks/ stalkers, destruction of reputations, dossier society)


    CCTV is one of the major ways that the corporations, individuals and the government
    tracks your movements. In London, UK the average person is caught on camera about
    500 times per day. This network is continuing to grow, and in many cities around
    the world, facial recognition is being rolled out, meaning the state can know
    the identity of residents on the footage in real-time.

    Strong authentication, encrypted devices, patched software and anonymous web
    browsing may be of little use if someone is able to physically compromise you,
    your devices and your data. This section outlines some basic methods for physical security

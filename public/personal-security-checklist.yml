    Standard guidlines for Project Management Actcities, Reporting and Measurement Tool
  checklist:
    - point: A Project Leader is nominated.

      priority: Essential
      details: Consider using a different email address for security-critical
        communications from trivial mail such as newsletters. This
        compartmentalization could reduce the amount of damage caused by a data
        breach, and also make it easier to recover a compromised account.
    - point: A Project Quality Manager is nominated.
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often
        the starting point for most phishing attacks.
    - point: A Project Architect is nominated
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging
        in. Your email account provides an easy entry point to all your other
        online accounts for an attacker.
    - point: Disable Automatic Loading of Remote Content
      priority: Essential
      details: Email messages can contain remote content such as images or
        stylesheets, often automatically loaded from the server. You should
        disable this, as it exposes your IP address and device information, and
        is often used for tracking. For more info, see [this
        article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20680903/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download).
    - point: Start-up version of Planning Document
      priority: Optional
      details:
        "There are two main types of emails on the internet: plaintext and
        HTML. The former is strongly preferred for privacy & security as HTML
        messages often include identifiers in links and inline images, which can
        collect usage and personal data. There's also numerous risks of remote
        code execution targeting the HTML parser of your mail client, which
        cannot be exploited if you are using plaintext. For more info, as well
        as setup instructions for your mail provider, see
        [UsePlaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/)."
    - point: All required QA activities for the next phase are planned and given in the project planning.
      priority: Optional
      details:
        If you give a third-party app or plug-in full access to your inbox,
        they effectively have full unhindered access to all your emails and
        their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks.
    - point: Requirements for project team members have been specified
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Emails are very easily intercepted. Furthermore, you can’t be sure of
        how secure your recipient's environment is. Therefore, emails cannot be
        considered safe for exchanging confidential information, unless it is
        encrypted.
- title: Messaging
  slug: messaging
  description: Keeping your communications private and secure
  icon: messaging
  intro: ""
  checklist:
    - point: Only Use Fully End-to-End Encrypted Messengers
      priority: Essential
      details:
        End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where messages are
        encrypted on your device and not decrypted until they reach the intended
        recipient. This ensures that any actor who intercepts traffic cannot
        read the message contents, nor can anybody with access to the central
        servers where data is stored.
    - point: Use only Open Source Messaging Platforms
      priority: Essential
      details: If code is open source then it can be independently examined and
        audited by anyone qualified to do so, to ensure that there are no
        backdoors, vulnerabilities, or other security issues.
    - point: Use a "Trustworthy" Messaging Platform
      priority: Essential
      details: When selecting an encrypted messaging app, ensure it's fully open
        source, stable, actively maintained, and ideally backed by reputable
        developers.
    - point: Check Security Settings
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Enable security settings, including contact verification, security
        notifications, and encryption. Disable optional non-security features
        such as read receipt, last online, and typing notification.
    - point: Ensure your Recipients Environment is Secure
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Your conversation can only be as secure as the weakest link. Often the
        easiest way to infiltrate a communications channel is to target the
        individual or node with the least protection.
    - point: Disable Cloud Services
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Some mobile messaging apps offer a web or desktop companion. This not
        only increases attack surface but it has been linked to several critical
        security issues, and should therefore be avoided, if possible.
    - point: Secure Group Chats
      priority: Essential
      details:
        The risk of compromise rises exponentially, the more participants are
        in a group, as the attack surface increases. Periodically check that all
        participants are legitimate.
    - point: Create a Safe Environment for Communication
      priority: Essential
      details:
        "There are several stages where your digital communications could be
        monitored or intercepted. This includes: your or your participants'
        device, your ISP, national gateway or government logging, the messaging
        provider, the servers."
    - point: Agree on a Communication Plan
      priority: Optional
      details:
        In certain situations, it may be worth making a communication plan.
        This should include primary and backup methods of securely getting in
        hold with each other.
    - point: Strip Meta-Data from Media
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Metadata is "Data about Data" or additional information attached to a
        file or transaction. When you send a photo, audio recording, video, or
        document you may be revealing more than you intended to.
    - point: Defang URLs
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Sending links via various services can unintentionally expose your
        personal information. This is because, when a thumbnail or preview is
        generated- it happens on the client-side.
    - point: Verify your Recipient
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Always ensure you are talking to the intended recipient, and that they
        have not been compromised. One method for doing so is to use an app
        which supports contact verification.
    - point: Enable Ephemeral Messages
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Self-destructing messages is a feature that causes your messages to
        automatically delete after a set amount of time. This means that if your
        device is lost, stolen, or seized, an adversary will only have access to
        the most recent communications.
    - point: Avoid SMS
      priority: Optional
      details: SMS may be convenient, but it's not secure. It is susceptible to
        threats such as interception, sim swapping, manipulation, and malware.
    - point: Watch out for Trackers
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Be wary of messaging applications with trackers, as the detailed usage
        statistics they collect are often very invasive, and can sometimes
        reveal your identity as well as personal information that you would
        otherwise not intend to share.
    - point: Consider Jurisdiction
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        The jurisdictions where the organisation is based, and data is hosted
        should also be taken into account.
    - point: Use an Anonymous Platform
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        If you believe you may be targeted, you should opt for an anonymous
        messaging platform that does not require a phone number, or any other
        personally identifiable information to sign up or use.
    - point: Ensure Forward Secrecy is Supported
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        Opt for a platform that implements forward secrecy. This is where your
        app generates a new encryption key for every message.
    - point: Consider a Decentralized Platform
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        If all data flows through a central provider, you have to trust them
        with your data and meta-data. You cannot verify that the system running
        is authentic without back doors.

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and
    give people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and
    share. Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction
    and bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking
    Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations, and
    that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and selling
    that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
    - point: Secure your Account
      priority: Essential
      details: "Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To
        protect your account: use a unique and strong password, and enable
        2-factor authentication."
    - point: Check Privacy Settings
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure
        that you are comfortable with what data you are currently exposing and
        to whom.
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
      priority: Essential
      details:
        There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content
        across many social networks. Therefore, before uploading, posting or
        commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"
    - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed
        up by a myriad of third-party services, who archive this data and make
        it indexable and publicly available almost forever.
    - point: Don't Reveal too Much
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of
        data that helps them personalize phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much
        detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).
    - point: Be Careful what you Upload
      priority: Essential
      details: Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally
        reveal a lot more than you intended them to. This is especially relevant
        to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.
    - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls
        and spammers more munition to use against you, and can also allow
        separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.
    - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
      priority: Essential
      details:
        By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for
        permission to access your contacts, call log, location, messaging
        history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.
    - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke
        access to social apps you no longer use.
    - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
      priority: Essential
      details:
        If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait
        until you have left that place. This is particularly important when you
        are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
        building or airport.
    - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive
        set of additional data (called EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove
        this data before uploading.
    - point: Implement Image Cloaking
      priority: Advanced
      details: Tools like Fawkes can be used to very subtly, slightly change the
        structure of faces within photos in a way that is imperceptible by
        humans, but will prevent facial recognition systems from being able to
        recognize a given face.
    - point: Consider Spoofing GPS in home vicinity
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        Even if you yourself never use social media, there is always going to
        be others who are not as careful, and could reveal your location.
    - point: Consider False Information
      priority: Advanced
      details: If you just want to read, and do not intend on posting too much-
        consider using an alias name, and false contact details.
    - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
      priority: Advanced
      details: Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online
        security and privacy, avoid using any mainstream social networks.

  intro: >
    This section covers standard practices in system testing workflow
  checklist:
    - point: All required QA activities for the next phase are planned and given in the project planning.
      priority: Essential
      details:
        Use a reputable, paid-for VPN. This can help protect sites you visit
        from logging your real IP, reduce the amount of data your ISP can
        collect, and increase protection on public WiFi.
    - point: All required workproducts are under configuration management control and if required approved.
      priority: Essential
      details: After getting a new router, change the password. Default router
        passwords are publicly available, meaning anyone within proximity would
        be able to connect.
    - point: Use WPA2, and a strong password
      priority: Essential
      details:
        There are different authentication protocols for connecting to WiFi.
        Currently, the most secure options are WPA2 and WPA3 (on newer routers).
    - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
      priority: Essential
      details: Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security
        vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and sometimes add features or
        improve the performance of your router.
    - point: Implement a Network-Wide VPN
      priority: Optional
      details:
        If you configure your VPN on your router, firewall, or home server,
        then traffic from all devices will be encrypted and routed through it,
        without needing individual VPN apps.
    - point: Protect against DNS leaks
      priority: Optional
      details:
        When using a VPN, it is extremely important to exclusively use the DNS
        server of your VPN provider or secure service.
    - point: Use a secure VPN Protocol
      priority: Optional
      details: OpenVPN and WireGuard are open source, lightweight, and secure
        tunneling protocols. Avoid using PPTP or SSTP.
    - point: Secure DNS
      priority: Optional
      details: Use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution via the HTTPS
        protocol, encrypting data between you and your DNS resolver.
    - point: Avoid the free router from your ISP
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Typically they’re manufactured cheaply in bulk in China, with insecure
        propriety firmware that doesn't receive regular security updates.
    - point: Whitelist MAC Addresses
      priority: Optional
      details:
        You can whitelist MAC addresses in your router settings, disallowing
        any unknown devices to immediately connect to your network, even if they
        know your credentials.
    - point: Change the Router’s Local IP Address
      priority: Optional
      details:
        It is possible for a malicious script in your web browser to exploit a
        cross-site scripting vulnerability, accessing known-vulnerable routers
        at their local IP address and tampering with them.
    - point: Don't Reveal Personal Info in SSID
      priority: Optional
      details:
        You should update your network name, choosing an SSID that does not
        identify you, include your flat number/address, and does not specify the
        device brand/model.
    - point: Opt-Out Router Listings
      priority: Optional
      details:
        WiFi SSIDs are scanned, logged, and then published on various websites,
        which is a serious privacy concern for some.
    - point: Hide your SSID
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Your router's Service Set Identifier is simply the network name. If it
        is not visible, it may receive less abuse.
    - point: Disable WPS
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides an easier method to connect, without
        entering a long WiFi password, but WPS introduces a series of major
        security issues.
    - point: Disable UPnP
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Universal Plug and Play allows applications to automatically forward a
        port on your router, but it has a long history of serious security
        issues.
    - point: Use a Guest Network for Guests
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Do not grant access to your primary WiFi network to visitors, as it
        enables them to interact with other devices on the network.
    - point: Change your Router's Default IP
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Modifying your router admin panel's default IP address will make it
        more difficult for malicious scripts targeting local IP addresses.
    - point: Kill unused processes and services on your router
      priority: Optional
      details: Services like Telnet and SSH that provide command-line access to
        devices should never be exposed to the internet and should also be
        disabled on the local network unless they're actually needed.
    - point: Don't have Open Ports
      priority: Optional
      details:
        Close any open ports on your router that are not needed. Open ports
        provide an easy entrance for hackers.
    - point: Disable Unused Remote Access Protocols
      priority: Optional
      details: When protocols such as PING, Telnet, SSH, UPnP, and HNAP etc are
        enabled, they allow your router to be probed from anywhere in the world.
    - point: Disable Cloud-Based Management
      priority: Optional
      details:
        You should treat your router's admin panel with the utmost care, as
        considerable damage can be caused if an attacker is able to gain access.
    - point: Manage Range Correctly
      priority: Optional
      details:
        It's common to want to pump your router's range to the max, but if you
        reside in a smaller flat, your attack surface is increased when your
        WiFi network can be picked up across the street.
    - point: Route all traffic through
        [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor)
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        VPNs have their weaknesses. For increased security, route all your
        internet traffic through the
        [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor) network.
    - point: Disable WiFi on all Devices
      priority: Advanced
      details:
        Connecting to even a secure WiFi network increases your attack surface.
        Disabling your home WiFi and connect each device via Ethernet.

  description: Reduce invasive tracking for cells, smartphones and tablets
  icon: mobile
  intro: >
    Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the
    world to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means
    of communication, entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've
    brought convenience to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on

    Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over who has this data- your phone is even able to [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371). Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html), and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent. And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

    Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions. It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

    This data is used for [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) - more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment. Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

    More of us are concerned about how [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/), and rightly so, federal agencies often [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/), [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/), Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence, [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html). And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.

    Public records often include sensitive personal data (full name, date of
    birth, phone number, email, address, ethnicity etc), and are gathered from a
    range of sources (census records, birth/ death/ marriage certificates, voter
    registrants, marketing information, customer databases, motor vehicle
    records, professional/ business licenses and all court files in full
    detail). This sensitive personal information is [easy and legal to
    access](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/its-creepy-but-not-illegal-for-this-website-to-provide-all-your-public-info-to-anyone/),

    CCTV is one of the major ways that the corporations, individuals and the government tracks your movements. In London, UK the average person is caught on camera about 500 times per day. This network is continuing to grow, and in many cities around the world, facial recognition is being rolled out, meaning the state can know the identity of residents on the footage in real-time.

    Strong authentication, encrypted devices, patched software and anonymous web browsing may be of little use if someone is able to physically compromise you, your devices and your data. This section outlines some basic methods for physical security
